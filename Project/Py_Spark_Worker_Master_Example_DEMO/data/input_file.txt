FRIENDS OF CHILDHOOD




I


Dr. Howard Archie had just come up from a game of pool with the Jewish
clothier and two traveling men who happened to be staying overnight in
Moonstone. His offices were in the Duke Block, over the drug store.
Larry, the doctorâ€™s man, had lit the overhead light in the waiting-room
and the double studentâ€™s lamp on the desk in the study. The isinglass
sides of the hard-coal burner were aglow, and the air in the study was
so hot that as he came in the doctor opened the door into his little
operating-room, where there was no stove. The waiting room was carpeted
and stiffly furnished, something like a country parlor. The study had
worn, unpainted floors, but there was a look of winter comfort about
it. The doctorâ€™s flat-top desk was large and well made; the papers were
in orderly piles, under glass weights. Behind the stove a wide
bookcase, with double glass doors, reached from the floor to the
ceiling. It was filled with medical books of every thickness and color.
On the top shelf stood a long row of thirty or forty volumes, bound all
alike in dark mottled board covers, with imitation leather backs.

As the doctor in New England villages is proverbially old, so the
doctor in small Colorado towns twenty-five years ago was generally
young. Dr. Archie was barely thirty. He was tall, with massive
shoulders which he held stiffly, and a large, well-shaped head. He was
a distinguished-looking man, for that part of the world, at least.

There was something individual in the way in which his reddish-brown
hair, parted cleanly at the side, bushed over his high forehead. His
nose was straight and thick, and his eyes were intelligent. He wore a
curly, reddish mustache and an imperial, cut trimly, which made him
look a little like the pictures of Napoleon III. His hands were large
and well kept, but ruggedly formed, and the backs were shaded with
crinkly reddish hair. He wore a blue suit of woolly, wide-waled serge;
the traveling men had known at a glance that it was made by a Denver
tailor. The doctor was always well dressed.

Dr. Archie turned up the studentâ€™s lamp and sat down in the swivel
chair before his desk. He sat uneasily, beating a tattoo on his knees
with his fingers, and looked about him as if he were bored. He glanced
at his watch, then absently took from his pocket a bunch of small keys,
selected one and looked at it. A contemptuous smile, barely
perceptible, played on his lips, but his eyes remained meditative.
Behind the door that led into the hall, under his buffalo-skin
driving-coat, was a locked cupboard. This the doctor opened
mechanically, kicking aside a pile of muddy overshoes. Inside, on the
shelves, were whiskey glasses and decanters, lemons, sugar, and
bitters. Hearing a step in the empty, echoing hall without, the doctor
closed the cupboard again, snapping the Yale lock. The door of the
waiting-room opened, a man entered and came on into the
consulting-room.

â€œGood-evening, Mr. Kronborg,â€  said the doctor carelessly. â€œSit down.â€ 

His visitor was a tall, loosely built man, with a thin brown beard,
streaked with gray. He wore a frock coat, a broad-brimmed black hat, a
white lawn necktie, and steel rimmed spectacles. Altogether there was a
pretentious and important air about him, as he lifted the skirts of his
coat and sat down.

â€œGood-evening, doctor. Can you step around to the house with me? I
think Mrs. Kronborg will need you this evening.â€  This was said with
profound gravity and, curiously enough, with a slight embarrassment.

â€œAny hurry?â€  the doctor asked over his shoulder as he went into his
operating-room.

Mr. Kronborg coughed behind his hand, and contracted his brows. His
face threatened at every moment to break into a smile of foolish
excitement. He controlled it only by calling upon his habitual pulpit
manner. â€œWell, I think it would be as well to go immediately. Mrs.
Kronborg will be more comfortable if you are there. She has been
suffering for some time.â€ 

The doctor came back and threw a black bag upon his desk. He wrote some
instructions for his man on a prescription pad and then drew on his
overcoat. â€œAll ready,â€  he announced, putting out his lamp. Mr. Kronborg
rose and they tramped through the empty hall and down the stairway to
the street. The drug store below was dark, and the saloon next door was
just closing. Every other light on Main Street was out.

On either side of the road and at the outer edge of the board sidewalk,
the snow had been shoveled into breastworks. The town looked small and
black, flattened down in the snow, muffled and all but extinguished.
Overhead the stars shone gloriously. It was impossible not to notice
them. The air was so clear that the white sand hills to the east of
Moonstone gleamed softly. Following the Reverend Mr. Kronborg along the
narrow walk, past the little dark, sleeping houses, the doctor looked
up at the flashing night and whistled softly. It did seem that people
were stupider than they need be; as if on a night like this there ought
to be something better to do than to sleep nine hours, or to assist
Mrs. Kronborg in functions which she could have performed so admirably
unaided. He wished he had gone down to Denver to hear Fay Templeton
sing â€œSee-Saw.â€  Then he remembered that he had a personal interest in
this family, after all. They turned into another street and saw before
them lighted windows; a low story-and-a-half house, with a wing built
on at the right and a kitchen addition at the back, everything a little
on the slantâ€”roofs, windows, and doors. As they approached the gate,
Peter Kronborgâ€™s pace grew brisker. His nervous, ministerial cough
annoyed the doctor. â€œExactly as if he were going to give out a text,â€ 
he thought. He drew off his glove and felt in his vest pocket. â€œHave a
troche, Kronborg,â€  he said, producing some. â€œSent me for samples. Very
good for a rough throat.â€ 

â€œAh, thank you, thank you. I was in something of a hurry. I neglected
to put on my overshoes. Here we are, doctor.â€  Kronborg opened his front
doorâ€”seemed delighted to be at home again.

The front hall was dark and cold; the hatrack was hung with an
astonishing number of childrenâ€™s hats and caps and cloaks. They were
even piled on the table beneath the hatrack. Under the table was a heap
of rubbers and overshoes. While the doctor hung up his coat and hat,
Peter Kronborg opened the door into the living-room. A glare of light
greeted them, and a rush of hot, stale air, smelling of warming
flannels.

At three oâ€™clock in the morning Dr. Archie was in the parlor putting on
his cuffs and coatâ€”there was no spare bedroom in that house. Peter
Kronborgâ€™s seventh child, a boy, was being soothed and cosseted by his
aunt, Mrs. Kronborg was asleep, and the doctor was going home. But he
wanted first to speak to Kronborg, who, coatless and fluttery, was
pouring coal into the kitchen stove. As the doctor crossed the
dining-room he paused and listened. From one of the wing rooms, off to
the left, he heard rapid, distressed breathing. He went to the kitchen
door.

â€œOne of the children sick in there?â€  he asked, nodding toward the
partition.

Kronborg hung up the stove-lifter and dusted his fingers. â€œIt must be
Thea. I meant to ask you to look at her. She has a croupy cold. But in
my excitementâ€”Mrs. Kronborg is doing finely, eh, doctor? Not many of
your patients with such a constitution, I expect.â€ 

â€œOh, yes. Sheâ€™s a fine mother.â€  The doctor took up the lamp from the
kitchen table and unceremoniously went into the wing room. Two chubby
little boys were asleep in a double bed, with the coverlids over their
noses and their feet drawn up. In a single bed, next to theirs, lay a
little girl of eleven, wide awake, two yellow braids sticking up on the
pillow behind her. Her face was scarlet and her eyes were blazing.

The doctor shut the door behind him. â€œFeel pretty sick, Thea?â€  he asked
as he took out his thermometer. â€œWhy didnâ€™t you call somebody?â€ 

She looked at him with greedy affection. â€œI thought you were here,â€  she
spoke between quick breaths. â€œThere is a new baby, isnâ€™t there? Which?â€ 

â€œWhich?â€  repeated the doctor.

â€œBrother or sister?â€ 

He smiled and sat down on the edge of the bed. â€œBrother,â€  he said,
taking her hand. â€œOpen.â€ 

â€œGood. Brothers are better,â€  she murmured as he put the glass tube
under her tongue.

â€œNow, be still, I want to count.â€  Dr. Archie reached for her hand and
took out his watch. When he put her hand back under the quilt he went
over to one of the windowsâ€”they were both tight shutâ€”and lifted it a
little way. He reached up and ran his hand along the cold, unpapered
wall. â€œKeep under the covers; Iâ€™ll come back to you in a moment,â€  he
said, bending over the glass lamp with his thermometer. He winked at
her from the door before he shut it.

Peter Kronborg was sitting in his wifeâ€™s room, holding the bundle which
contained his son. His air of cheerful importance, his beard and
glasses, even his shirt-sleeves, annoyed the doctor. He beckoned
Kronborg into the living-room and said sternly:â€”

â€œYouâ€™ve got a very sick child in there. Why didnâ€™t you call me before?
Itâ€™s pneumonia, and she must have been sick for several days. Put the
baby down somewhere, please, and help me make up the bed-lounge here in
the parlor. Sheâ€™s got to be in a warm room, and sheâ€™s got to be quiet.
You must keep the other children out. Here, this thing opens up, I
see,â€  swinging back the top of the carpet lounge. â€œWe can lift her
mattress and carry her in just as she is. I donâ€™t want to disturb her
more than is necessary.â€ 

Kronborg was all concern immediately. The two men took up the mattress
and carried the sick child into the parlor. â€œIâ€™ll have to go down to my
office to get some medicine, Kronborg. The drug store wonâ€™t be open.
Keep the covers on her. I wonâ€™t be gone long. Shake down the stove and
put on a little coal, but not too much; so itâ€™ll catch quickly, I mean.
Find an old sheet for me, and put it there to warm.â€ 

The doctor caught his coat and hurried out into the dark street. Nobody
was stirring yet, and the cold was bitter. He was tired and hungry and
in no mild humor. â€œThe idea!â€  he muttered; â€œto be such an ass at his
age, about the seventh! And to feel no responsibility about the little
girl. Silly old goat! The baby would have got into the world somehow;
they always do. But a nice little girl like thatâ€”sheâ€™s worth the whole
litter. Where she ever got it fromâ€”â€  He turned into the Duke Block and
ran up the stairs to his office.

Thea Kronborg, meanwhile, was wondering why she happened to be in the
parlor, where nobody but companyâ€”usually visiting preachersâ€”ever slept.
She had moments of stupor when she did not see anything, and moments of
excitement when she felt that something unusual and pleasant was about
to happen, when she saw everything clearly in the red light from the
isinglass sides of the hard-coal burnerâ€”the nickel trimmings on the
stove itself, the pictures on the wall, which she thought very
beautiful, the flowers on the Brussels carpet, Czernyâ€™s â€œDaily Studiesâ€ 
which stood open on the upright piano. She forgot, for the time being,
all about the new baby.

When she heard the front door open, it occurred to her that the
pleasant thing which was going to happen was Dr. Archie himself. He
came in and warmed his hands at the stove. As he turned to her, she
threw herself wearily toward him, half out of her bed. She would have
tumbled to the floor had he not caught her. He gave her some medicine
and went to the kitchen for something he needed. She drowsed and lost
the sense of his being there. When she opened her eyes again, he was
kneeling before the stove, spreading something dark and sticky on a
white cloth, with a big spoon; batter, perhaps. Presently she felt him
taking off her nightgown. He wrapped the hot plaster about her chest.
There seemed to be straps which he pinned over her shoulders. Then he
took out a thread and needle and began to sew her up in it. That, she
felt, was too strange; she must be dreaming anyhow, so she succumbed to
her drowsiness.

Thea had been moaning with every breath since the doctor came back, but
she did not know it. She did not realize that she was suffering pain.
When she was conscious at all, she seemed to be separated from her
body; to be perched on top of the piano, or on the hanging lamp,
watching the doctor sew her up. It was perplexing and unsatisfactory,
like dreaming. She wished she could waken up and see what was going on.

The doctor thanked God that he had persuaded Peter Kronborg to keep out
of the way. He could do better by the child if he had her to himself.
He had no children of his own. His marriage was a very unhappy one. As
he lifted and undressed Thea, he thought to himself what a beautiful
thing a little girlâ€™s body was,â€”like a flower. It was so neatly and
delicately fashioned, so soft, and so milky white. Thea must have got
her hair and her silky skin from her mother. She was a little Swede,
through and through. Dr. Archie could not help thinking how he would
cherish a little creature like this if she were his. Her hands, so
little and hot, so clever, too,â€”he glanced at the open exercise book on
the piano. When he had stitched up the flaxseed jacket, he wiped it
neatly about the edges, where the paste had worked out on the skin. He
put on her the clean nightgown he had warmed before the fire, and
tucked the blankets about her. As he pushed back the hair that had
fuzzed down over her eyebrows, he felt her head thoughtfully with the
tips of his fingers. No, he couldnâ€™t say that it was different from any
other childâ€™s head, though he believed that there was something very
different about her. He looked intently at her wide, flushed face,
freckled nose, fierce little mouth, and her delicate, tender chinâ€”the
one soft touch in her hard little Scandinavian face, as if some fairy
godmother had caressed her there and left a cryptic promise. Her brows
were usually drawn together defiantly, but never when she was with Dr.
Archie. Her affection for him was prettier than most of the things that
went to make up the doctorâ€™s life in Moonstone.

The windows grew gray. He heard a tramping on the attic floor, on the
back stairs, then cries: â€œGive me my shirt!â€  â€œWhereâ€™s my other
stocking?â€ 

â€œIâ€™ll have to stay till they get off to school,â€  he reflected, â€œor
theyâ€™ll be in here tormenting her, the whole lot of them.â€ 




II


For the next four days it seemed to Dr. Archie that his patient might
slip through his hands, do what he might. But she did not. On the
contrary, after that she recovered very rapidly. As her father
remarked, she must have inherited the â€œconstitutionâ€  which he was never
tired of admiring in her mother.

One afternoon, when her new brother was a week old, the doctor found
Thea very comfortable and happy in her bed in the parlor. The sunlight
was pouring in over her shoulders, the baby was asleep on a pillow in a
big rocking-chair beside her. Whenever he stirred, she put out her hand
and rocked him. Nothing of him was visible but a flushed, puffy
forehead and an uncompromisingly big, bald cranium. The door into her
motherâ€™s room stood open, and Mrs. Kronborg was sitting up in bed
darning stockings. She was a short, stalwart woman, with a short neck
and a determined-looking head. Her skin was very fair, her face calm
and unwrinkled, and her yellow hair, braided down her back as she lay
in bed, still looked like a girlâ€™s. She was a woman whom Dr. Archie
respected; active, practical, unruffled; goodhumored, but determined.
Exactly the sort of woman to take care of a flighty preacher. She had
brought her husband some property, too,â€”one fourth of her fatherâ€™s
broad acres in Nebraska,â€”but this she kept in her own name. She had
profound respect for her husbandâ€™s erudition and eloquence. She sat
under his preaching with deep humility, and was as much taken in by his
stiff shirt and white neckties as if she had not ironed them herself by
lamplight the night before they appeared correct and spotless in the
pulpit. But for all this, she had no confidence in his administration
of worldly affairs. She looked to him for morning prayers and grace at
table; she expected him to name the babies and to supply whatever
parental sentiment there was in the house, to remember birthdays and
anniversaries, to point the children to moral and patriotic ideals. It
was her work to keep their bodies, their clothes, and their conduct in
some sort of order, and this she accomplished with a success that was a
source of wonder to her neighbors. As she used to remark, and her
husband admiringly to echo, she â€œhad never lost one.â€  With all his
flightiness, Peter Kronborg appreciated the matter-of-fact, punctual
way in which his wife got her children into the world and along in it.
He believed, and he was right in believing, that the sovereign State of
Colorado was much indebted to Mrs. Kronborg and women like her.

Mrs. Kronborg believed that the size of every family was decided in
heaven. More modern views would not have startled her; they would
simply have seemed foolishâ€”thin chatter, like the boasts of the men who
built the tower of Babel, or like Axelâ€™s plan to breed ostriches in the
chicken yard. From what evidence Mrs. Kronborg formed her opinions on
this and other matters, it would have been difficult to say, but once
formed, they were unchangeable. She would no more have questioned her
convictions than she would have questioned revelation. Calm and even
tempered, naturally kind, she was capable of strong prejudices, and she
never forgave.

When the doctor came in to see Thea, Mrs. Kronborg was reflecting that
the washing was a week behind, and deciding what she had better do
about it. The arrival of a new baby meant a revision of her entire
domestic schedule, and as she drove her needle along she had been
working out new sleeping arrangements and cleaning days. The doctor had
entered the house without knocking, after making noise enough in the
hall to prepare his patients. Thea was reading, her book propped up
before her in the sunlight.

â€œMustnâ€™t do that; bad for your eyes,â€  he said, as Thea shut the book
quickly and slipped it under the covers.

Mrs. Kronborg called from her bed: â€œBring the baby here, doctor, and
have that chair. She wanted him in there for company.â€ 

Before the doctor picked up the baby, he put a yellow paper bag down on
Theaâ€™s coverlid and winked at her. They had a code of winks and
grimaces. When he went in to chat with her mother, Thea opened the bag
cautiously, trying to keep it from crackling. She drew out a long bunch
of white grapes, with a little of the sawdust in which they had been
packed still clinging to them. They were called Malaga grapes in
Moonstone, and once or twice during the winter the leading grocer got a
keg of them. They were used mainly for table decoration, about
Christmas-time. Thea had never had more than one grape at a time
before. When the doctor came back she was holding the almost
transparent fruit up in the sunlight, feeling the pale-green skins
softly with the tips of her fingers. She did not thank him; she only
snapped her eyes at him in a special way which he understood, and, when
he gave her his hand, put it quickly and shyly under her cheek, as if
she were trying to do so without knowing itâ€”and without his knowing it.

Dr. Archie sat down in the rocking-chair. â€œAnd howâ€™s Thea feeling
to-day?â€ 

He was quite as shy as his patient, especially when a third person
overheard his conversation. Big and handsome and superior to his fellow
townsmen as Dr. Archie was, he was seldom at his ease, and like Peter
Kronborg he often dodged behind a professional manner. There was
sometimes a contraction of embarrassment and self consciousness all
over his big body, which made him awkwardâ€”likely to stumble, to kick up
rugs, or to knock over chairs. If any one was very sick, he forgot
himself, but he had a clumsy touch in convalescent gossip.

Thea curled up on her side and looked at him with pleasure. â€œAll right.
I like to be sick. I have more fun then than other times.â€ 

â€œHowâ€™s that?â€ 

â€œI donâ€™t have to go to school, and I donâ€™t have to practice. I can read
all I want to, and have good things,â€ â€”she patted the grapes. â€œI had
lots of fun that time I mashed my finger and you wouldnâ€™t let Professor
Wunsch make me practice. Only I had to do left hand, even then. I think
that was mean.â€ 

The doctor took her hand and examined the forefinger, where the nail
had grown back a little crooked. â€œYou mustnâ€™t trim it down close at the
corner there, and then it will grow straight. You wonâ€™t want it crooked
when youâ€™re a big girl and wear rings and have sweethearts.â€ 

She made a mocking little face at him and looked at his new scarf-pin.
â€œThatâ€™s the prettiest one you ev-ER had. I wish youâ€™d stay a long while
and let me look at it. What is it?â€ 

Dr. Archie laughed. â€œItâ€™s an opal. Spanish Johnny brought it up for me
from Chihuahua in his shoe. I had it set in Denver, and I wore it
to-day for your benefit.â€ 

Thea had a curious passion for jewelry. She wanted every shining stone
she saw, and in summer she was always going off into the sand hills to
hunt for crystals and agates and bits of pink chalcedony. She had two
cigar boxes full of stones that she had found or traded for, and she
imagined that they were of enormous value. She was always planning how
she would have them set.

â€œWhat are you reading?â€  The doctor reached under the covers and pulled
out a book of Byronâ€™s poems. â€œDo you like this?â€ 

She looked confused, turned over a few pages rapidly, and pointed to
â€œMy native land, good-night.â€  â€œThat,â€  she said sheepishly.

â€œHow about â€˜Maid of Athensâ€™?â€ 

She blushed and looked at him suspiciously. â€œI like â€˜There was a sound
of revelry,â€™â€  she muttered.

The doctor laughed and closed the book. It was clumsily bound in padded
leather and had been presented to the Reverend Peter Kronborg by his
Sunday-School class as an ornament for his parlor table.

â€œCome into the office some day, and Iâ€™ll lend you a nice book. You can
skip the parts you donâ€™t understand. You can read it in vacation.
Perhaps youâ€™ll be able to understand all of it by then.â€ 

Thea frowned and looked fretfully toward the piano. â€œIn vacation I have
to practice four hours every day, and then thereâ€™ll be Thor to take
care of.â€  She pronounced it â€œTor.â€ 

â€œThor? Oh, youâ€™ve named the baby Thor?â€  exclaimed the doctor.

Thea frowned again, still more fiercely, and said quickly, â€œThatâ€™s a
nice name, only maybe itâ€™s a littleâ€”old fashioned.â€  She was very
sensitive about being thought a foreigner, and was proud of the fact
that, in town, her father always preached in English; very bookish
English, at that, one might add.

Born in an old Scandinavian colony in Minnesota, Peter Kronborg had
been sent to a small divinity school in Indiana by the women of a
Swedish evangelical mission, who were convinced of his gifts and who
skimped and begged and gave church suppers to get the long, lazy youth
through the seminary. He could still speak enough Swedish to exhort and
to bury the members of his country church out at Copper Hole, and he
wielded in his Moonstone pulpit a somewhat pompous English vocabulary
he had learned out of books at college. He always spoke of â€œthe infant
Saviour,â€  â€œour Heavenly Father,â€  etc. The poor man had no natural,
spontaneous human speech. If he had his sincere moments, they were
perforce inarticulate. Probably a good deal of his pretentiousness was
due to the fact that he habitually expressed himself in a book learned
language, wholly remote from anything personal, native, or homely. Mrs.
Kronborg spoke Swedish to her own sisters and to her sister-in-law
Tillie, and colloquial English to her neighbors. Thea, who had a rather
sensitive ear, until she went to school never spoke at all, except in
monosyllables, and her mother was convinced that she was tongue-tied.
She was still inept in speech for a child so intelligent. Her ideas
were usually clear, but she seldom attempted to explain them, even at
school, where she excelled in â€œwritten workâ€  and never did more than
mutter a reply.

â€œYour music professor stopped me on the street to-day and asked me how
you were,â€  said the doctor, rising. â€œHeâ€™ll be sick himself, trotting
around in this slush with no overcoat or overshoes.â€ 

â€œHeâ€™s poor,â€  said Thea simply.

The doctor sighed. â€œIâ€™m afraid heâ€™s worse than that. Is he always all
right when you take your lessons? Never acts as if heâ€™d been drinking?â€ 

Thea looked angry and spoke excitedly. â€œHe knows a lot. More than
anybody. I donâ€™t care if he does drink; heâ€™s old and poor.â€  Her voice
shook a little.

Mrs. Kronborg spoke up from the next room. â€œHeâ€™s a good teacher,
doctor. Itâ€™s good for us he does drink. Heâ€™d never be in a little place
like this if he didnâ€™t have some weakness. These women that teach music
around here donâ€™t know nothing. I wouldnâ€™t have my child wasting time
with them. If Professor Wunsch goes away, Theaâ€™ll have nobody to take
from. Heâ€™s careful with his scholars; he donâ€™t use bad language. Mrs.
Kohler is always present when Thea takes her lesson. Itâ€™s all right.â€ 
Mrs. Kronborg spoke calmly and judicially. One could see that she had
thought the matter out before.

â€œIâ€™m glad to hear that, Mrs. Kronborg. I wish we could get the old man
off his bottle and keep him tidy. Do you suppose if I gave you an old
overcoat you could get him to wear it?â€  The doctor went to the bedroom
door and Mrs. Kronborg looked up from her darning.

â€œWhy, yes, I guess heâ€™d be glad of it. Heâ€™ll take most anything from
me. He wonâ€™t buy clothes, but I guess heâ€™d wear â€™em if he had â€™em. Iâ€™ve
never had any clothes to give him, having so many to make over for.â€ 

â€œIâ€™ll have Larry bring the coat around to-night. You arenâ€™t cross with
me, Thea?â€  taking her hand.

Thea grinned warmly. â€œNot if you give Professor Wunsch a coatâ€”and
things,â€  she tapped the grapes significantly. The doctor bent over and
kissed her.




III


Being sick was all very well, but Thea knew from experience that
starting back to school again was attended by depressing difficulties.
One Monday morning she got up early with Axel and Gunner, who shared
her wing room, and hurried into the back living-room, between the
dining-room and the kitchen. There, beside a soft-coal stove, the
younger children of the family undressed at night and dressed in the
morning. The older daughter, Anna, and the two big boys slept upstairs,
where the rooms were theoretically warmed by stovepipes from below. The
first (and the worst!) thing that confronted Thea was a suit of clean,
prickly red flannel, fresh from the wash. Usually the torment of
breaking in a clean suit of flannel came on Sunday, but yesterday, as
she was staying in the house, she had begged off. Their winter
underwear was a trial to all the children, but it was bitterest to Thea
because she happened to have the most sensitive skin. While she was
tugging it on, her Aunt Tillie brought in warm water from the boiler
and filled the tin pitcher. Thea washed her face, brushed and braided
her hair, and got into her blue cashmere dress. Over this she buttoned
a long apron, with sleeves, which would not be removed until she put on
her cloak to go to school. Gunner and Axel, on the soap box behind the
stove, had their usual quarrel about which should wear the tightest
stockings, but they exchanged reproaches in low tones, for they were
wholesomely afraid of Mrs. Kronborgâ€™s rawhide whip. She did not
chastise her children often, but she did it thoroughly. Only a somewhat
stern system of discipline could have kept any degree of order and
quiet in that overcrowded house.

Mrs. Kronborgâ€™s children were all trained to dress themselves at the
earliest possible age, to make their own beds,â€”the boys as well as the
girls,â€”to take care of their clothes, to eat what was given them, and
to keep out of the way. Mrs. Kronborg would have made a good chess
player; she had a head for moves and positions.

Anna, the elder daughter, was her motherâ€™s lieutenant. All the children
knew that they must obey Anna, who was an obstinate contender for
proprieties and not always fair minded. To see the young Kronborgs
headed for Sunday School was like watching a military drill. Mrs.
Kronborg let her childrenâ€™s minds alone. She did not pry into their
thoughts or nag them. She respected them as individuals, and outside of
the house they had a great deal of liberty. But their communal life was
definitely ordered.

In the winter the children breakfasted in the kitchen; Gus and Charley
and Anna first, while the younger children were dressing. Gus was
nineteen and was a clerk in a dry-goods store. Charley, eighteen months
younger, worked in a feed store. They left the house by the kitchen
door at seven oâ€™clock, and then Anna helped her Aunt Tillie get the
breakfast for the younger ones. Without the help of this sister-in-law,
Tillie Kronborg, Mrs. Kronborgâ€™s life would have been a hard one. Mrs.
Kronborg often reminded Anna that â€œno hired help would ever have taken
the same interest.â€ 

Mr. Kronborg came of a poorer stock than his wife; from a lowly,
ignorant family that had lived in a poor part of Sweden. His
great-grandfather had gone to Norway to work as a farm laborer and had
married a Norwegian girl. This strain of Norwegian blood came out
somewhere in each generation of the Kronborgs. The intemperance of one
of Peter Kronborgâ€™s uncles, and the religious mania of another, had
been alike charged to the Norwegian grandmother. Both Peter Kronborg
and his sister Tillie were more like the Norwegian root of the family
than like the Swedish, and this same Norwegian strain was strong in
Thea, though in her it took a very different character.

Tillie was a queer, addle-pated thing, as flighty as a girl at
thirty-five, and overweeningly fond of gay clothesâ€”which taste, as Mrs.
Kronborg philosophically said, did nobody any harm. Tillie was always
cheerful, and her tongue was still for scarcely a minute during the
day. She had been cruelly overworked on her fatherâ€™s Minnesota farm
when she was a young girl, and she had never been so happy as she was
now; had never before, as she said, had such social advantages. She
thought her brother the most important man in Moonstone. She never
missed a church service, and, much to the embarrassment of the
children, she always â€œspoke a pieceâ€  at the Sunday-School concerts. She
had a complete set of â€œStandard Recitations,â€  which she conned on
Sundays. This morning, when Thea and her two younger brothers sat down
to breakfast, Tillie was remonstrating with Gunner because he had not
learned a recitation assigned to him for George Washington Day at
school. The unmemorized text lay heavily on Gunnerâ€™s conscience as he
attacked his buckwheat cakes and sausage. He knew that Tillie was in
the right, and that â€œwhen the day came he would be ashamed of himself.â€ 

â€œI donâ€™t care,â€  he muttered, stirring his coffee; â€œthey oughtnâ€™t to
make boys speak. Itâ€™s all right for girls. They like to show off.â€ 

â€œNo showing off about it. Boys ought to like to speak up for their
country. And what was the use of your father buying you a new suit, if
youâ€™re not going to take part in anything?â€ 

â€œThat was for Sunday-School. Iâ€™d rather wear my old one, anyhow. Why
didnâ€™t they give the piece to Thea?â€  Gunner grumbled.

Tillie was turning buckwheat cakes at the griddle. â€œThea can play and
sing, she donâ€™t need to speak. But youâ€™ve got to know how to do
something, Gunner, that you have. What are you going to do when you git
big and want to git into society, if you canâ€™t do nothing? Everybodyâ€™ll
say, â€˜Can you sing? Can you play? Can you speak? Then git right out of
society.â€™ Anâ€™ thatâ€™s what theyâ€™ll say to you, Mr. Gunner.â€ 

Gunner and Alex grinned at Anna, who was preparing her motherâ€™s
breakfast. They never made fun of Tillie, but they understood well
enough that there were subjects upon which her ideas were rather
foolish. When Tillie struck the shallows, Thea was usually prompt in
turning the conversation.

â€œWill you and Axel let me have your sled at recess?â€  she asked.

â€œAll the time?â€  asked Gunner dubiously.

â€œIâ€™ll work your examples for you to-night, if you do.â€ 

â€œOh, all right. Thereâ€™ll be a lot of â€™em.â€ 

â€œI donâ€™t mind, I can work â€™em fast. How about yours, Axel?â€ 

Axel was a fat little boy of seven, with pretty, lazy blue eyes. â€œI
donâ€™t care,â€  he murmured, buttering his last buckwheat cake without
ambition; â€œtoo much trouble to copy â€™em down. Jenny Smileyâ€™ll let me
have hers.â€ 

The boys were to pull Thea to school on their sled, as the snow was
deep. The three set off together. Anna was now in the high school, and
she no longer went with the family party, but walked to school with
some of the older girls who were her friends, and wore a hat, not a
hood like Thea.




IV


â€œAnd it was Summer, beautiful Summer!â€  Those were the closing words of
Theaâ€™s favorite fairy tale, and she thought of them as she ran out into
the world one Saturday morning in May, her music book under her arm.
She was going to the Kohlersâ€™ to take her lesson, but she was in no
hurry.

It was in the summer that one really lived. Then all the little
overcrowded houses were opened wide, and the wind blew through them
with sweet, earthy smells of garden-planting. The town looked as if it
had just been washed. People were out painting their fences. The
cottonwood trees were a-flicker with sticky, yellow little leaves, and
the feathery tamarisks were in pink bud. With the warm weather came
freedom for everybody. People were dug up, as it were. The very old
people, whom one had not seen all winter, came out and sunned
themselves in the yard. The double windows were taken off the houses,
the tormenting flannels in which children had been encased all winter
were put away in boxes, and the youngsters felt a pleasure in the cool
cotton things next their skin.

Thea had to walk more than a mile to reach the Kohlersâ€™ house, a very
pleasant mile out of town toward the glittering sand hills,â€”yellow this
morning, with lines of deep violet where the clefts and valleys were.
She followed the sidewalk to the depot at the south end of the town;
then took the road east to the little group of adobe houses where the
Mexicans lived, then dropped into a deep ravine; a dry sand creek,
across which the railroad track ran on a trestle. Beyond that gulch, on
a little rise of ground that faced the open sandy plain, was the
Kohlersâ€™ house, where Professor Wunsch lived. Fritz Kohler was the town
tailor, one of the first settlers. He had moved there, built a little
house and made a garden, when Moonstone was first marked down on the
map. He had three sons, but they now worked on the railroad and were
stationed in distant cities. One of them had gone to work for the Santa
FÃ©, and lived in New Mexico.

Mrs. Kohler seldom crossed the ravine and went into the town except at
Christmas-time, when she had to buy presents and Christmas cards to
send to her old friends in Freeport, Illinois. As she did not go to
church, she did not possess such a thing as a hat. Year after year she
wore the same red hood in winter and a black sunbonnet in summer. She
made her own dresses; the skirts came barely to her shoe-tops, and were
gathered as full as they could possibly be to the waistband. She
preferred menâ€™s shoes, and usually wore the cast-offs of one of her
sons. She had never learned much English, and her plants and shrubs
were her companions. She lived for her men and her garden. Beside that
sand gulch, she had tried to reproduce a bit of her own village in the
Rhine Valley. She hid herself behind the growth she had fostered, lived
under the shade of what she had planted and watered and pruned. In the
blaze of the open plain she was stupid and blind like an owl. Shade,
shade; that was what she was always planning and making. Behind the
high tamarisk hedge, her garden was a jungle of verdure in summer.
Above the cherry trees and peach trees and golden plums stood the
windmill, with its tank on stilts, which kept all this verdure alive.
Outside, the sage-brush grew up to the very edge of the garden, and the
sand was always drifting up to the tamarisks.

Every one in Moonstone was astonished when the Kohlers took the
wandering music-teacher to live with them. In seventeen years old Fritz
had never had a crony, except the harness-maker and Spanish Johnny.
This Wunsch came from God knew where,â€”followed Spanish Johnny into town
when that wanderer came back from one of his tramps. Wunsch played in
the dance orchestra, tuned pianos, and gave lessons. When Mrs. Kohler
rescued him, he was sleeping in a dirty, unfurnished room over one of
the saloons, and he had only two shirts in the world. Once he was under
her roof, the old woman went at him as she did at her garden. She sewed
and washed and mended for him, and made him so clean and respectable
that he was able to get a large class of pupils and to rent a piano. As
soon as he had money ahead, he sent to the Narrow Gauge lodging-house,
in Denver, for a trunkful of music which had been held there for unpaid
board. With tears in his eyes the old manâ€”he was not over fifty, but
sadly batteredâ€”told Mrs. Kohler that he asked nothing better of God
than to end his days with her, and to be buried in the garden, under
her linden trees. They were not American basswood, but the European
linden, which has honey-colored blooms in summer, with a fragrance that
surpasses all trees and flowers and drives young people wild with joy.

Thea was reflecting as she walked along that had it not been for
Professor Wunsch she might have lived on for years in Moonstone without
ever knowing the Kohlers, without ever seeing their garden or the
inside of their house. Besides the cuckoo clock,â€”which was wonderful
enough, and which Mrs. Kohler said she kept for â€œcompany when she was
lonesome,â€ â€”the Kohlers had in their house the most wonderful thing Thea
had ever seenâ€”but of that later.

Professor Wunsch went to the houses of his other pupils to give them
their lessons, but one morning he told Mrs. Kronborg that Thea had
talent, and that if she came to him he could teach her in his slippers,
and that would be better. Mrs. Kronborg was a strange woman. That word
â€œtalent,â€  which no one else in Moonstone, not even Dr. Archie, would
have understood, she comprehended perfectly. To any other woman there,
it would have meant that a child must have her hair curled every day
and must play in public. Mrs. Kronborg knew it meant that Thea must
practice four hours a day. A child with talent must be kept at the
piano, just as a child with measles must be kept under the blankets.
Mrs. Kronborg and her three sisters had all studied piano, and all sang
well, but none of them had talent. Their father had played the oboe in
an orchestra in Sweden, before he came to America to better his
fortunes. He had even known Jenny Lind. A child with talent had to be
kept at the piano; so twice a week in summer and once a week in winter
Thea went over the gulch to the Kohlersâ€™, though the Ladiesâ€™ Aid
Society thought it was not proper for their preacherâ€™s daughter to go
â€œwhere there was so much drinking.â€  Not that the Kohler sons ever so
much as looked at a glass of beer. They were ashamed of their old folks
and got out into the world as fast as possible; had their clothes made
by a Denver tailor and their necks shaved up under their hair and
forgot the past. Old Fritz and Wunsch, however, indulged in a friendly
bottle pretty often. The two men were like comrades; perhaps the bond
between them was the glass wherein lost hopes are found; perhaps it was
common memories of another country; perhaps it was the grapevine in the
gardenâ€”knotty, fibrous shrub, full of homesickness and sentiment, which
the Germans have carried around the world with them.

As Thea approached the house she peeped between the pink sprays of the
tamarisk hedge and saw the Professor and Mrs. Kohler in the garden,
spading and raking. The garden looked like a relief-map now, and gave
no indication of what it would be in August; such a jungle! Pole beans
and potatoes and corn and leeks and kale and red cabbageâ€”there would
even be vegetables for which there is no American name. Mrs. Kohler was
always getting by mail packages of seeds from Freeport and from the old
country. Then the flowers! There were big sunflowers for the canary
bird, tiger lilies and phlox and zinnias and ladyâ€™s-slippers and
portulaca and hollyhocks,â€”giant hollyhocks. Beside the fruit trees
there was a great umbrella-shaped catalpa, and a balm-of-Gilead, two
lindens, and even a ginka,â€”a rigid, pointed tree with leaves shaped
like butterflies, which shivered, but never bent to the wind.

This morning Thea saw to her delight that the two oleander trees, one
white and one red, had been brought up from their winter quarters in
the cellar. There is hardly a German family in the most arid parts of
Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, but has its oleander trees. However loutish
the American-born sons of the family may be, there was never one who
refused to give his muscle to the back-breaking task of getting those
tubbed trees down into the cellar in the fall and up into the sunlight
in the spring. They may strive to avert the day, but they grapple with
the tub at last.

When Thea entered the gate, her professor leaned his spade against the
white post that supported the turreted dove-house, and wiped his face
with his shirt-sleeve; someway he never managed to have a handkerchief
about him. Wunsch was short and stocky, with something rough and
bear-like about his shoulders. His face was a dark, bricky red, deeply
creased rather than wrinkled, and the skin was like loose leather over
his neck bandâ€”he wore a brass collar button but no collar. His hair was
cropped close; iron-gray bristles on a bullet-like head. His eyes were
always suffused and bloodshot. He had a coarse, scornful mouth, and
irregular, yellow teeth, much worn at the edges. His hands were square
and red, seldom clean, but always alive, impatient, even sympathetic.

â€œ_Morgen_,â€  he greeted his pupil in a businesslike way, put on a black
alpaca coat, and conducted her at once to the piano in Mrs. Kohlerâ€™s
sitting-room. He twirled the stool to the proper height, pointed to it,
and sat down in a wooden chair beside Thea.

â€œThe scale of B flat major,â€  he directed, and then fell into an
attitude of deep attention. Without a word his pupil set to work.

To Mrs. Kohler, in the garden, came the cheerful sound of effort, of
vigorous striving. Unconsciously she wielded her rake more lightly.
Occasionally she heard the teacherâ€™s voice. â€œScale of E minor....
_Weiter, weiter!... Immer_ I hear the thumb, like a lame foot.
_Weiter... weiter_, once... _SchÃ¶n!_ The chords, quick!â€ 

The pupil did not open her mouth until they began the second movement
of the Clementi sonata, when she remonstrated in low tones about the
way he had marked the fingering of a passage.

â€œIt makes no matter what you think,â€  replied her teacher coldly. â€œThere
is only one right way. The thumb there. _Ein, zwei, drei, vier_,â€  etc.
Then for an hour there was no further interruption.

At the end of the lesson Thea turned on her stool and leaned her arm on
the keyboard. They usually had a little talk after the lesson.

Herr Wunsch grinned. â€œHow soon is it you are free from school? Then we
make ahead faster, eh?â€ 

â€œFirst week in June. Then will you give me the â€˜Invitation to the
Danceâ€™?â€ 

He shrugged his shoulders. â€œIt makes no matter. If you want him, you
play him out of lesson hours.â€ 

â€œAll right.â€  Thea fumbled in her pocket and brought out a crumpled slip
of paper. â€œWhat does this mean, please? I guess itâ€™s Latin.â€ 

Wunsch blinked at the line penciled on the paper. â€œWherefrom you get
this?â€  he asked gruffly.

â€œOut of a book Dr. Archie gave me to read. Itâ€™s all English but that.
Did you ever see it before?â€  she asked, watching his face.

â€œYes. A long time ago,â€  he muttered, scowling. â€œOvidius!â€  He took a
stub of lead pencil from his vest pocket, steadied his hand by a
visible effort, and under the words:

â€œLente currite, lente currite, noctis equi,â€ 


he wrote in a clear, elegant Gothic hand,â€”

â€œGo slowly, go slowly, ye steeds of the night.â€ 


He put the pencil back in his pocket and continued to stare at the
Latin. It recalled the poem, which he had read as a student, and
thought very fine. There were treasures of memory which no
lodging-house keeper could attach. One carried things about in oneâ€™s
head, long after oneâ€™s linen could be smuggled out in a tuning-bag. He
handed the paper back to Thea. â€œThere is the English, quite elegant,â€ 
he said, rising.

Mrs. Kohler stuck her head in at the door, and Thea slid off the stool.
â€œCome in, Mrs. Kohler,â€  she called, â€œand show me the piece-picture.â€ 

The old woman laughed, pulled off her big gardening gloves, and pushed
Thea to the lounge before the object of her delight. The
â€œpiece-picture,â€  which hung on the wall and nearly covered one whole
end of the room, was the handiwork of Fritz Kohler. He had learned his
trade under an old-fashioned tailor in Magdeburg who required from each
of his apprentices a thesis: that is, before they left his shop, each
apprentice had to copy in cloth some well known German painting,
stitching bits of colored stuff together on a linen background; a kind
of mosaic. The pupil was allowed to select his subject, and Fritz
Kohler had chosen a popular painting of Napoleonâ€™s retreat from Moscow.
The gloomy Emperor and his staff were represented as crossing a stone
bridge, and behind them was the blazing city, the walls and fortresses
done in gray cloth with orange tongues of flame darting about the domes
and minarets. Napoleon rode his white horse; Murat, in Oriental dress,
a bay charger. Thea was never tired of examining this work, of hearing
how long it had taken Fritz to make it, how much it had been admired,
and what narrow escapes it had had from moths and fire. Silk, Mrs.
Kohler explained, would have been much easier to manage than woolen
cloth, in which it was often hard to get the right shades. The reins of
the horses, the wheels of the spurs, the brooding eyebrows of the
Emperor, Muratâ€™s fierce mustaches, the great shakos of the Guard, were
all worked out with the minutest fidelity. Theaâ€™s admiration for this
picture had endeared her to Mrs. Kohler. It was now many years since
she used to point out its wonders to her own little boys. As Mrs.
Kohler did not go to church, she never heard any singing, except the
songs that floated over from Mexican Town, and Thea often sang for her
after the lesson was over. This morning Wunsch pointed to the piano.

â€œOn Sunday, when I go by the church, I hear you sing something.â€ 

Thea obediently sat down on the stool again and began, â€œ_Come, ye
Disconsolate_.â€  Wunsch listened thoughtfully, his hands on his knees.
Such a beautiful childâ€™s voice! Old Mrs. Kohlerâ€™s face relaxed in a
smile of happiness; she half closed her eyes. A big fly was darting in
and out of the window; the sunlight made a golden pool on the rag
carpet and bathed the faded cretonne pillows on the lounge, under the
piece-picture. â€œ_Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal_,â€  the
song died away.

â€œThat is a good thing to remember,â€  Wunsch shook himself. â€œYou believe
that?â€  looking quizzically at Thea.

She became confused and pecked nervously at a black key with her middle
finger. â€œI donâ€™t know. I guess so,â€  she murmured.

Her teacher rose abruptly. â€œRemember, for next time, thirds. You ought
to get up earlier.â€ 

That night the air was so warm that Fritz and Herr Wunsch had their
after-supper pipe in the grape arbor, smoking in silence while the
sound of fiddles and guitars came across the ravine from Mexican Town.
Long after Fritz and his old Paulina had gone to bed, Wunsch sat
motionless in the arbor, looking up through the woolly vine leaves at
the glittering machinery of heaven.

â€œLente currite, noctis equi.â€ 


That line awoke many memories. He was thinking of youth; of his own, so
long gone by, and of his pupilâ€™s, just beginning. He would even have
cherished hopes for her, except that he had become superstitious. He
believed that whatever he hoped for was destined not to be; that his
affection brought ill-fortune, especially to the young; that if he held
anything in his thoughts, he harmed it. He had taught in music schools
in St. Louis and Kansas City, where the shallowness and complacency of
the young misses had maddened him. He had encountered bad manners and
bad faith, had been the victim of sharpers of all kinds, was dogged by
bad luck. He had played in orchestras that were never paid and
wandering opera troupes which disbanded penniless. And there was always
the old enemy, more relentless than the others. It was long since he
had wished anything or desired anything beyond the necessities of the
body. Now that he was tempted to hope for another, he felt alarmed and
shook his head.

It was his pupilâ€™s power of application, her rugged will, that
interested him. He had lived for so long among people whose sole
ambition was to get something for nothing that he had learned not to
look for seriousness in anything. Now that he by chance encountered it,
it recalled standards, ambitions, a society long forgot. What was it
she reminded him of? A yellow flower, full of sunlight, perhaps. No; a
thin glass full of sweet-smelling, sparkling Moselle wine. He seemed to
see such a glass before him in the arbor, to watch the bubbles rising
and breaking, like the silent discharge of energy in the nerves and
brain, the rapid florescence in young bloodâ€”Wunsch felt ashamed and
dragged his slippers along the path to the kitchen, his eyes on the
ground.




V


The children in the primary grades were sometimes required to make
relief maps of Moonstone in sand. Had they used colored sands, as the
Navajo medicine men do in their sand mosaics, they could easily have
indicated the social classifications of Moonstone, since these
conformed to certain topographical boundaries, and every child
understood them perfectly.

The main business street ran, of course, through the center of the
town. To the west of this street lived all the people who were, as
Tillie Kronborg said, â€œin society.â€  Sylvester Street, the third
parallel with Main Street on the west, was the longest in town, and the
best dwellings were built along it. Far out at the north end, nearly a
mile from the court-house and its cottonwood grove, was Dr. Archieâ€™s
house, its big yard and garden surrounded by a white paling fence. The
Methodist Church was in the center of the town, facing the court-house
square. The Kronborgs lived half a mile south of the church, on the
long street that stretched out like an arm to the depot settlement.
This was the first street west of Main, and was built up only on one
side. The preacherâ€™s house faced the backs of the brick and frame store
buildings and a draw full of sunflowers and scraps of old iron. The
sidewalk which ran in front of the Kronborgsâ€™ house was the one
continuous sidewalk to the depot, and all the train men and roundhouse
employees passed the front gate every time they came uptown. Thea and
Mrs. Kronborg had many friends among the railroad men, who often paused
to chat across the fence, and of one of these we shall have more to
say.

In the part of Moonstone that lay east of Main Street, toward the deep
ravine which, farther south, wound by Mexican Town, lived all the
humbler citizens, the people who voted but did not run for office. The
houses were little story-and-a-half cottages, with none of the fussy
architectural efforts that marked those on Sylvester Street. They
nestled modestly behind their cottonwoods and Virginia creeper; their
occupants had no social pretensions to keep up. There were no
half-glass front doors with doorbells, or formidable parlors behind
closed shutters. Here the old women washed in the back yard, and the
men sat in the front doorway and smoked their pipes. The people on
Sylvester Street scarcely knew that this part of the town existed. Thea
liked to take Thor and her express wagon and explore these quiet, shady
streets, where the people never tried to have lawns or to grow elms and
pine trees, but let the native timber have its way and spread in
luxuriance. She had many friends there, old women who gave her a yellow
rose or a spray of trumpet vine and appeased Thor with a cooky or a
doughnut. They called Thea â€œthat preacherâ€™s girl,â€  but the
demonstrative was misplaced, for when they spoke of Mr. Kronborg they
called him â€œthe Methodist preacher.â€ 

Dr. Archie was very proud of his yard and garden, which he worked
himself. He was the only man in Moonstone who was successful at growing
rambler roses, and his strawberries were famous. One morning when Thea
was downtown on an errand, the doctor stopped her, took her hand and
went over her with a quizzical eye, as he nearly always did when they
met.

â€œYou havenâ€™t been up to my place to get any strawberries yet, Thea.
Theyâ€™re at their best just now. Mrs. Archie doesnâ€™t know what to do
with them all. Come up this afternoon. Just tell Mrs. Archie I sent
you. Bring a big basket and pick till you are tired.â€ 

When she got home Thea told her mother that she didnâ€™t want to go,
because she didnâ€™t like Mrs. Archie.

â€œShe is certainly one queer woman,â€  Mrs. Kronborg assented, â€œbut heâ€™s
asked you so often, I guess youâ€™ll have to go this time. She wonâ€™t bite
you.â€ 

After dinner Thea took a basket, put Thor in his baby buggy, and set
out for Dr. Archieâ€™s house at the other end of town. As soon as she
came within sight of the house, she slackened her pace. She approached
it very slowly, stopping often to pick dandelions and sand-peas for
Thor to crush up in his fist.

It was his wifeâ€™s custom, as soon as Dr. Archie left the house in the
morning, to shut all the doors and windows to keep the dust out, and to
pull down the shades to keep the sun from fading the carpets. She
thought, too, that neighbors were less likely to drop in if the house
was closed up. She was one of those people who are stingy without
motive or reason, even when they can gain nothing by it. She must have
known that skimping the doctor in heat and food made him more
extravagant than he would have been had she made him comfortable. He
never came home for lunch, because she gave him such miserable scraps
and shreds of food. No matter how much milk he bought, he could never
get thick cream for his strawberries. Even when he watched his wife
lift it from the milk in smooth, ivory-colored blankets, she managed,
by some sleight-of-hand, to dilute it before it got to the breakfast
table. The butcherâ€™s favorite joke was about the kind of meat he sold
Mrs. Archie. She felt no interest in food herself, and she hated to
prepare it. She liked nothing better than to have Dr. Archie go to
Denver for a few daysâ€”he often went chiefly because he was hungryâ€”and
to be left alone to eat canned salmon and to keep the house shut up
from morning until night.

Mrs. Archie would not have a servant because, she said, â€œthey ate too
much and broke too muchâ€ ; she even said they knew too much. She used
what mind she had in devising shifts to minimize her housework. She
used to tell her neighbors that if there were no men, there would be no
housework. When Mrs. Archie was first married, she had been always in a
panic for fear she would have children. Now that her apprehensions on
that score had grown paler, she was almost as much afraid of having
dust in the house as she had once been of having children in it. If
dust did not get in, it did not have to be got out, she said. She would
take any amount of trouble to avoid trouble. Why, nobody knew.
Certainly her husband had never been able to make her out. Such little,
mean natures are among the darkest and most baffling of created things.
There is no law by which they can be explained. The ordinary incentives
of pain and pleasure do not account for their behavior. They live like
insects, absorbed in petty activities that seem to have nothing to do
with any genial aspect of human life.

Mrs. Archie, as Mrs. Kronborg said, â€œliked to gad.â€  She liked to have
her house clean, empty, dark, locked, and to be out of itâ€”anywhere. A
church social, a prayer meeting, a ten-cent show; she seemed to have no
preference. When there was nowhere else to go, she used to sit for
hours in Mrs. Smileyâ€™s millinery and notion store, listening to the
talk of the women who came in, watching them while they tried on hats,
blinking at them from her corner with her sharp, restless little eyes.
She never talked much herself, but she knew all the gossip of the town
and she had a sharp ear for racy anecdotesâ€”â€œtraveling menâ€™s stories,â€ 
they used to be called in Moonstone. Her clicking laugh sounded like a
typewriting machine in action, and, for very pointed stories, she had a
little screech.

Mrs. Archie had been Mrs. Archie for only six years, and when she was
Belle White she was one of the â€œprettyâ€  girls in Lansing, Michigan. She
had then a train of suitors. She could truly remind Archie that â€œthe
boys hung around her.â€  They did. They thought her very spirited and
were always saying, â€œOh, that Belle White, sheâ€™s a case!â€  She used to
play heavy practical jokes which the young men thought very clever.
Archie was considered the most promising young man in â€œthe young
crowd,â€  so Belle selected him. She let him see, made him fully aware,
that she had selected him, and Archie was the sort of boy who could not
withstand such enlightenment. Belleâ€™s family were sorry for him. On his
wedding day her sisters looked at the big, handsome boyâ€”he was
twenty-fourâ€”as he walked down the aisle with his bride, and then they
looked at each other. His besotted confidence, his sober, radiant face,
his gentle, protecting arm, made them uncomfortable. Well, they were
glad that he was going West at once, to fulfill his doom where they
would not be onlookers. Anyhow, they consoled themselves, they had got
Belle off their hands.

More than that, Belle seemed to have got herself off her hands. Her
reputed prettiness must have been entirely the result of determination,
of a fierce little ambition. Once she had married, fastened herself on
some one, come to port,â€”it vanished like the ornamental plumage which
drops away from some birds after the mating season. The one aggressive
action of her life was over. She began to shrink in face and stature.
Of her harum-scarum spirit there was nothing left but the little
screech. Within a few years she looked as small and mean as she was.

Thorâ€™s chariot crept along. Thea approached the house unwillingly. She
didnâ€™t care about the strawberries, anyhow. She had come only because
she did not want to hurt Dr. Archieâ€™s feelings. She not only disliked
Mrs. Archie, she was a little afraid of her. While Thea was getting the
heavy baby-buggy through the iron gate she heard some one call, â€œWait a
minute!â€  and Mrs. Archie came running around the house from the back
door, her apron over her head. She came to help with the buggy, because
she was afraid the wheels might scratch the paint off the gateposts.
She was a skinny little woman with a great pile of frizzy light hair on
a small head.

â€œDr. Archie told me to come up and pick some strawberries,â€  Thea
muttered, wishing she had stayed at home.

Mrs. Archie led the way to the back door, squinting and shading her
eyes with her hand. â€œWait a minute,â€  she said again, when Thea
explained why she had come.

She went into her kitchen and Thea sat down on the porch step. When
Mrs. Archie reappeared she carried in her hand a little wooden
butter-basket trimmed with fringed tissue paper, which she must have
brought home from some church supper. â€œYouâ€™ll have to have something to
put them in,â€  she said, ignoring the yawning willow basket which stood
empty on Thorâ€™s feet. â€œYou can have this, and you neednâ€™t mind about
returning it. You know about not trampling the vines, donâ€™t you?â€ 

Mrs. Archie went back into the house and Thea leaned over in the sand
and picked a few strawberries. As soon as she was sure that she was not
going to cry, she tossed the little basket into the big one and ran
Thorâ€™s buggy along the gravel walk and out of the gate as fast as she
could push it. She was angry, and she was ashamed for Dr. Archie. She
could not help thinking how uncomfortable he would be if he ever found
out about it. Little things like that were the ones that cut him most.
She slunk home by the back way, and again almost cried when she told
her mother about it.

Mrs. Kronborg was frying doughnuts for her husbandâ€™s supper. She
laughed as she dropped a new lot into the hot grease. â€œItâ€™s wonderful,
the way some people are made,â€  she declared. â€œBut I wouldnâ€™t let that
upset me if I was you. Think what it would be to live with it all the
time. You look in the black pocketbook inside my handbag and take a
dime and go downtown and get an ice-cream soda. Thatâ€™ll make you feel
better. Thor can have a little of the ice-cream if you feed it to him
with a spoon. He likes it, donâ€™t you, son?â€  She stooped to wipe his
chin. Thor was only six months old and inarticulate, but it was quite
true that he liked ice-cream.




VI


Seen from a balloon, Moonstone would have looked like a Noahâ€™s ark town
set out in the sand and lightly shaded by gray-green tamarisks and
cottonwoods. A few people were trying to make soft maples grow in their
turfed lawns, but the fashion of planting incongruous trees from the
North Atlantic States had not become general then, and the frail,
brightly painted desert town was shaded by the light-reflecting,
wind-loving trees of the desert, whose roots are always seeking water
and whose leaves are always talking about it, making the sound of rain.
The long porous roots of the cottonwood are irrepressible. They break
into the wells as rats do into granaries, and thieve the water.

The long street which connected Moonstone with the depot settlement
traversed in its course a considerable stretch of rough open country,
staked out in lots but not built up at all, a weedy hiatus between the
town and the railroad. When you set out along this street to go to the
station, you noticed that the houses became smaller and farther apart,
until they ceased altogether, and the board sidewalk continued its
uneven course through sunflower patches, until you reached the
solitary, new brick Catholic Church. The church stood there because the
land was given to the parish by the man who owned the adjoining waste
lots, in the hope of making them more salableâ€”â€œFarrierâ€™s Addition,â€ 
this patch of prairie was called in the clerkâ€™s office. An eighth of a
mile beyond the church was a washout, a deep sand-gully, where the
board sidewalk became a bridge for perhaps fifty feet. Just beyond the
gully was old Uncle Billy Beemerâ€™s grove,â€”twelve town lots set out in
fine, well-grown cottonwood trees, delightful to look upon, or to
listen to, as they swayed and rippled in the wind. Uncle Billy had been
one of the most worthless old drunkards who ever sat on a store box and
told filthy stories. One night he played hide-and-seek with a switch
engine and got his sodden brains knocked out. But his grove, the one
creditable thing he had ever done in his life, rustled on. Beyond this
grove the houses of the depot settlement began, and the naked board
walk, that had run in out of the sunflowers, again became a link
between human dwellings.

One afternoon, late in the summer, Dr. Howard Archie was fighting his
way back to town along this walk through a blinding sandstorm, a silk
handkerchief tied over his mouth. He had been to see a sick woman down
in the depot settlement, and he was walking because his ponies had been
out for a hard drive that morning.

As he passed the Catholic Church he came upon Thea and Thor. Thea was
sitting in a childâ€™s express wagon, her feet out behind, kicking the
wagon along and steering by the tongue. Thor was on her lap and she
held him with one arm. He had grown to be a big cub of a baby, with a
constitutional grievance, and he had to be continually amused. Thea
took him philosophically, and tugged and pulled him about, getting as
much fun as she could under her encumbrance. Her hair was blowing about
her face, and her eyes were squinting so intently at the uneven board
sidewalk in front of her that she did not see the doctor until he spoke
to her.

â€œLook out, Thea. Youâ€™ll steer that youngster into the ditch.â€ 

The wagon stopped. Thea released the tongue, wiped her hot, sandy face,
and pushed back her hair. â€œOh, no, I wonâ€™t! I never ran off but once,
and then he didnâ€™t get anything but a bump. He likes this better than a
baby buggy, and so do I.â€ 

â€œAre you going to kick that cart all the way home?â€ 

â€œOf course. We take long trips; wherever there is a sidewalk. Itâ€™s no
good on the road.â€ 

â€œLooks to me like working pretty hard for your fun. Are you going to be
busy to-night? Want to make a call with me? Spanish Johnnyâ€™s come home
again, all used up. His wife sent me word this morning, and I said Iâ€™d
go over to see him to-night. Heâ€™s an old chum of yours, isnâ€™t he?â€ 

â€œOh, Iâ€™m glad. Sheâ€™s been crying her eyes out. When did he come?â€ 

â€œLast night, on Number Six. Paid his fare, they tell me. Too sick to
beat it. Thereâ€™ll come a time when that boy wonâ€™t get back, Iâ€™m afraid.
Come around to my office about eight oâ€™clock,â€”and you neednâ€™t bring
that!â€ 

Thor seemed to understand that he had been insulted, for he scowled and
began to kick the side of the wagon, shouting, â€œGo-go, go-go!â€  Thea
leaned forward and grabbed the wagon tongue. Dr. Archie stepped in
front of her and blocked the way. â€œWhy donâ€™t you make him wait? What do
you let him boss you like that for?â€ 

â€œIf he gets mad he throws himself, and then I canâ€™t do anything with
him. When heâ€™s mad heâ€™s lots stronger than me, arenâ€™t you, Thor?â€  Thea
spoke with pride, and the idol was appeased. He grunted approvingly as
his sister began to kick rapidly behind her, and the wagon rattled off
and soon disappeared in the flying currents of sand.

That evening Dr. Archie was seated in his office, his desk chair tilted
back, reading by the light of a hot coal-oil lamp. All the windows were
open, but the night was breathless after the sandstorm, and his hair
was moist where it hung over his forehead. He was deeply engrossed in
his book and sometimes smiled thoughtfully as he read. When Thea
Kronborg entered quietly and slipped into a seat, he nodded, finished
his paragraph, inserted a bookmark, and rose to put the book back into
the case. It was one out of the long row of uniform volumes on the top
shelf.

â€œNearly every time I come in, when youâ€™re alone, youâ€™re reading one of
those books,â€  Thea remarked thoughtfully. â€œThey must be very nice.â€ 

The doctor dropped back into his swivel chair, the mottled volume still
in his hand. â€œThey arenâ€™t exactly books, Thea,â€  he said seriously.
â€œTheyâ€™re a city.â€ 

â€œA history, you mean?â€ 

â€œYes, and no. Theyâ€™re a history of a live city, not a dead one. A
Frenchman undertook to write about a whole cityful of people, all the
kinds he knew. And he got them nearly all in, I guess. Yes, itâ€™s very
interesting. Youâ€™ll like to read it some day, when youâ€™re grown up.â€ 

Thea leaned forward and made out the title on the back, â€œA
Distinguished Provincial in Paris.â€ 

â€œIt doesnâ€™t sound very interesting.â€ 

â€œPerhaps not, but it is.â€  The doctor scrutinized her broad face, low
enough to be in the direct light from under the green lamp shade.
â€œYes,â€  he went on with some satisfaction, â€œI think youâ€™ll like them
some day. Youâ€™re always curious about people, and I expect this man
knew more about people than anybody that ever lived.â€ 

â€œCity people or country people?â€ 

â€œBoth. People are pretty much the same everywhere.â€ 

â€œOh, no, theyâ€™re not. The people who go through in the dining-car
arenâ€™t like us.â€ 

â€œWhat makes you think they arenâ€™t, my girl? Their clothes?â€ 

Thea shook her head. â€œNo, itâ€™s something else. I donâ€™t know.â€  Her eyes
shifted under the doctorâ€™s searching gaze and she glanced up at the row
of books. â€œHow soon will I be old enough to read them?â€ 

â€œSoon enough, soon enough, little girl.â€  The doctor patted her hand and
looked at her index finger. â€œThe nailâ€™s coming all right, isnâ€™t it? But
I think that man makes you practice too much. You have it on your mind
all the time.â€  He had noticed that when she talked to him she was
always opening and shutting her hands. â€œIt makes you nervous.â€ 

â€œNo, he donâ€™t,â€  Thea replied stubbornly, watching Dr. Archie return the
book to its niche.

He took up a black leather case, put on his hat, and they went down the
dark stairs into the street. The summer moon hung full in the sky. For
the time being, it was the great fact in the world. Beyond the edge of
the town the plain was so white that every clump of sage stood out
distinct from the sand, and the dunes looked like a shining lake. The
doctor took off his straw hat and carried it in his hand as they walked
toward Mexican Town, across the sand.

North of Pueblo, Mexican settlements were rare in Colorado then. This
one had come about accidentally. Spanish Johnny was the first Mexican
who came to Moonstone. He was a painter and decorator, and had been
working in Trinidad, when Ray Kennedy told him there was a â€œboomâ€  on in
Moonstone, and a good many new buildings were going up. A year after
Johnny settled in Moonstone, his cousin, Famos SerreÃ±os, came to work
in the brickyard; then SerreÃ±osâ€™ cousins came to help him. During the
strike, the master mechanic put a gang of Mexicans to work in the
roundhouse. The Mexicans had arrived so quietly, with their blankets
and musical instruments, that before Moonstone was awake to the fact,
there was a Mexican quarter; a dozen families or more.

As Thea and the doctor approached the â€™dobe houses, they heard a
guitar, and a rich barytone voiceâ€”that of Famos SerreÃ±osâ€”singing â€œLa
Golandrina.â€  All the Mexican houses had neat little yards, with
tamarisk hedges and flowers, and walks bordered with shells or
whitewashed stones. Johnnyâ€™s house was dark. His wife, Mrs.
Tellamantez, was sitting on the doorstep, combing her long, blue-black
hair. (Mexican women are like the Spartans; when they are in trouble,
in love, under stress of any kind, they comb and comb their hair.) She
rose without embarrassment or apology, comb in hand, and greeted the
doctor.

â€œGood-evening; will you go in?â€  she asked in a low, musical voice. â€œHe
is in the back room. I will make a light.â€  She followed them indoors,
lit a candle and handed it to the doctor, pointing toward the bedroom.
Then she went back and sat down on her doorstep.

Dr. Archie and Thea went into the bedroom, which was dark and quiet.
There was a bed in the corner, and a man was lying on the clean sheets.
On the table beside him was a glass pitcher, half-full of water.
Spanish Johnny looked younger than his wife, and when he was in health
he was very handsome: slender, gold-colored, with wavy black hair, a
round, smooth throat, white teeth, and burning black eyes. His profile
was strong and severe, like an Indianâ€™s. What was termed his â€œwildnessâ€ 
showed itself only in his feverish eyes and in the color that burned on
his tawny cheeks. That night he was a coppery green, and his eyes were
like black holes. He opened them when the doctor held the candle before
his face.

â€œ_Mi testa!_â€  he muttered, â€œ_mi testa_,â€  doctor. â€œ_La fiebre!_â€  Seeing
the doctorâ€™s companion at the foot of the bed, he attempted a smile.
â€œ_Muchacha!_â€  he exclaimed deprecatingly.

Dr. Archie stuck a thermometer into his mouth. â€œNow, Thea, you can run
outside and wait for me.â€ 

Thea slipped noiselessly through the dark house and joined Mrs.
Tellamantez. The somber Mexican woman did not seem inclined to talk,
but her nod was friendly. Thea sat down on the warm sand, her back to
the moon, facing Mrs. Tellamantez on her doorstep, and began to count
the moon flowers on the vine that ran over the house. Mrs. Tellamantez
was always considered a very homely woman. Her face was of a strongly
marked type not sympathetic to Americans. Such long, oval faces, with a
full chin, a large, mobile mouth, a high nose, are not uncommon in
Spain. Mrs. Tellamantez could not write her name, and could read but
little. Her strong nature lived upon itself. She was chiefly known in
Moonstone for her forbearance with her incorrigible husband.

Nobody knew exactly what was the matter with Johnny, and everybody
liked him. His popularity would have been unusual for a white man, for
a Mexican it was unprecedented. His talents were his undoing. He had a
high, uncertain tenor voice, and he played the mandolin with
exceptional skill. Periodically he went crazy. There was no other way
to explain his behavior. He was a clever workman, and, when he worked,
as regular and faithful as a burro. Then some night he would fall in
with a crowd at the saloon and begin to sing. He would go on until he
had no voice left, until he wheezed and rasped. Then he would play his
mandolin furiously, and drink until his eyes sank back into his head.
At last, when he was put out of the saloon at closing time, and could
get nobody to listen to him, he would run awayâ€”along the railroad
track, straight across the desert. He always managed to get aboard a
freight somewhere. Once beyond Denver, he played his way southward from
saloon to saloon until he got across the border. He never wrote to his
wife; but she would soon begin to get newspapers from La Junta,
Albuquerque, Chihuahua, with marked paragraphs announcing that Juan
Tellamantez and his wonderful mandolin could be heard at the Jack
Rabbit Grill, or the Pearl of Cadiz Saloon. Mrs. Tellamantez waited and
wept and combed her hair. When he was completely wrung out and burned
up,â€”all but destroyed,â€”her Juan always came back to her to be taken
care of,â€”once with an ugly knife wound in the neck, once with a finger
missing from his right hand,â€”but he played just as well with three
fingers as he had with four.

Public sentiment was lenient toward Johnny, but everybody was disgusted
with Mrs. Tellamantez for putting up with him. She ought to discipline
him, people said; she ought to leave him; she had no self-respect. In
short, Mrs. Tellamantez got all the blame. Even Thea thought she was
much too humble. To-night, as she sat with her back to the moon,
looking at the moon flowers and Mrs. Tellamantezâ€™s somber face, she was
thinking that there is nothing so sad in the world as that kind of
patience and resignation. It was much worse than Johnnyâ€™s craziness.
She even wondered whether it did not help to make Johnny crazy. People
had no right to be so passive and resigned. She would like to roll over
and over in the sand and screech at Mrs. Tellamantez. She was glad when
the doctor came out.

The Mexican woman rose and stood respectful and expectant. The doctor
held his hat in his hand and looked kindly at her.

â€œSame old thing, Mrs. Tellamantez. Heâ€™s no worse than heâ€™s been before.
Iâ€™ve left some medicine. Donâ€™t give him anything but toast water until
I see him again. Youâ€™re a good nurse; youâ€™ll get him out.â€  Dr. Archie
smiled encouragingly. He glanced about the little garden and wrinkled
his brows. â€œI canâ€™t see what makes him behave so. Heâ€™s killing himself,
and heâ€™s not a rowdy sort of fellow. Canâ€™t you tie him up someway?
Canâ€™t you tell when these fits are coming on?â€ 

Mrs. Tellamantez put her hand to her forehead. â€œThe saloon, doctor, the
excitement; that is what makes him. People listen to him, and it
excites him.â€ 

The doctor shook his head. â€œMaybe. Heâ€™s too much for my calculations. I
donâ€™t see what he gets out of it.â€ 

â€œHe is always fooled,â€ â€”the Mexican woman spoke rapidly and tremulously,
her long under lip quivering.

â€œHe is good at heart, but he has no head. He fools himself. You do not
understand in this country, you are progressive. But he has no
judgment, and he is fooled.â€  She stooped quickly, took up one of the
white conch-shells that bordered the walk, and, with an apologetic
inclination of her head, held it to Dr. Archieâ€™s ear. â€œListen, doctor.
You hear something in there? You hear the sea; and yet the sea is very
far from here. You have judgment, and you know that. But he is fooled.
To him, it is the sea itself. A little thing is big to him.â€  She bent
and placed the shell in the white row, with its fellows. Thea took it
up softly and pressed it to her own ear. The sound in it startled her;
it was like something calling one. So that was why Johnny ran away.
There was something awe-inspiring about Mrs. Tellamantez and her shell.

Thea caught Dr. Archieâ€™s hand and squeezed it hard as she skipped along
beside him back toward Moonstone. She went home, and the doctor went
back to his lamp and his book. He never left his office until after
midnight. If he did not play whist or pool in the evening, he read. It
had become a habit with him to lose himself.




VII


Theaâ€™s twelfth birthday had passed a few weeks before her memorable
call upon Mrs. Tellamantez. There was a worthy man in Moonstone who was
already planning to marry Thea as soon as she should be old enough. His
name was Ray Kennedy, his age was thirty, and he was conductor on a
freight train, his run being from Moonstone to Denver. Ray was a big
fellow, with a square, open American face, a rock chin, and features
that one would never happen to remember. He was an aggressive idealist,
a freethinker, and, like most railroad men, deeply sentimental. Thea
liked him for reasons that had to do with the adventurous life he had
led in Mexico and the Southwest, rather than for anything very
personal. She liked him, too, because he was the only one of her
friends who ever took her to the sand hills. The sand hills were a
constant tantalization; she loved them better than anything near
Moonstone, and yet she could so seldom get to them. The first dunes
were accessible enough; they were only a few miles beyond the Kohlersâ€™,
and she could run out there any day when she could do her practicing in
the morning and get Thor off her hands for an afternoon. But the real
hillsâ€”the Turquoise Hills, the Mexicans called themâ€”were ten good miles
away, and one reached them by a heavy, sandy road. Dr. Archie sometimes
took Thea on his long drives, but as nobody lived in the sand hills, he
never had calls to make in that direction. Ray Kennedy was her only
hope of getting there.

This summer Thea had not been to the hills once, though Ray had planned
several Sunday expeditions. Once Thor was sick, and once the organist
in her fatherâ€™s church was away and Thea had to play the organ for the
three Sunday services. But on the first Sunday in September, Ray drove
up to the Kronborgsâ€™ front gate at nine oâ€™clock in the morning and the
party actually set off. Gunner and Axel went with Thea, and Ray had
asked Spanish Johnny to come and to bring Mrs. Tellamantez and his
mandolin. Ray was artlessly fond of music, especially of Mexican music.
He and Mrs. Tellamantez had got up the lunch between them, and they
were to make coffee in the desert.

When they left Mexican Town, Thea was on the front seat with Ray and
Johnny, and Gunner and Axel sat behind with Mrs. Tellamantez. They
objected to this, of course, but there were some things about which
Thea would have her own way. â€œAs stubborn as a Finn,â€  Mrs. Kronborg
sometimes said of her, quoting an old Swedish saying. When they passed
the Kohlersâ€™, old Fritz and Wunsch were cutting grapes at the arbor.
Thea gave them a businesslike nod. Wunsch came to the gate and looked
after them. He divined Ray Kennedyâ€™s hopes, and he distrusted every
expedition that led away from the piano. Unconsciously he made Thea pay
for frivolousness of this sort.

As Ray Kennedyâ€™s party followed the faint road across the sagebrush,
they heard behind them the sound of church bells, which gave them a
sense of escape and boundless freedom. Every rabbit that shot across
the path, every sage hen that flew up by the trail, was like a runaway
thought, a message that one sent into the desert. As they went farther,
the illusion of the mirage became more instead of less convincing; a
shallow silver lake that spread for many miles, a little misty in the
sunlight. Here and there one saw reflected the image of a heifer,
turned loose to live upon the sparse sand-grass. They were magnified to
a preposterous height and looked like mammoths, prehistoric beasts
standing solitary in the waters that for many thousands of years
actually washed over that desert;â€”the mirage itself may be the ghost of
that long-vanished sea. Beyond the phantom lake lay the line of
many-colored hills; rich, sun-baked yellow, glowing turquoise,
lavender, purple; all the open, pastel colors of the desert.

After the first five miles the road grew heavier. The horses had to
slow down to a walk and the wheels sank deep into the sand, which now
lay in long ridges, like waves, where the last high wind had drifted
it. Two hours brought the party to Pedroâ€™s Cup, named for a Mexican
desperado who had once held the sheriff at bay there. The Cup was a
great amphitheater, cut out in the hills, its floor smooth and packed
hard, dotted with sagebrush and greasewood.

On either side of the Cup the yellow hills ran north and south, with
winding ravines between them, full of soft sand which drained down from
the crumbling banks. On the surface of this fluid sand, one could find
bits of brilliant stone, crystals and agates and onyx, and petrified
wood as red as blood. Dried toads and lizards were to be found there,
too. Birds, decomposing more rapidly, left only feathered skeletons.

After a little reconnoitering, Mrs. Tellamantez declared that it was
time for lunch, and Ray took his hatchet and began to cut greasewood,
which burns fiercely in its green state. The little boys dragged the
bushes to the spot that Mrs. Tellamantez had chosen for her fire.
Mexican women like to cook out of doors.

After lunch Thea sent Gunner and Axel to hunt for agates. â€œIf you see a
rattlesnake, run. Donâ€™t try to kill it,â€  she enjoined.

Gunner hesitated. â€œIf Ray would let me take the hatchet, I could kill
one all right.â€ 

Mrs. Tellamantez smiled and said something to Johnny in Spanish.

â€œYes,â€  her husband replied, translating, â€œthey say in Mexico, kill a
snake but never hurt his feelings. Down in the hot country,
_muchacha_,â€  turning to Thea, â€œpeople keep a pet snake in the house to
kill rats and mice. They call him the house snake. They keep a little
mat for him by the fire, and at night he curl up there and sit with the
family, just as friendly!â€ 

Gunner sniffed with disgust. â€œWell, I think thatâ€™s a dirty Mexican way
to keep house; so there!â€ 

Johnny shrugged his shoulders. â€œPerhaps,â€  he muttered. A Mexican learns
to dive below insults or soar above them, after he crosses the border.

By this time the south wall of the amphitheater cast a narrow shelf of
shadow, and the party withdrew to this refuge. Ray and Johnny began to
talk about the Grand Canyon and Death Valley, two places much shrouded
in mystery in those days, and Thea listened intently. Mrs. Tellamantez
took out her drawn-work and pinned it to her knee. Ray could talk well
about the large part of the continent over which he had been knocked
about, and Johnny was appreciative.

â€œYou been all over, pretty near. Like a Spanish boy,â€  he commented
respectfully.

Ray, who had taken off his coat, whetted his pocketknife thoughtfully
on the sole of his shoe. â€œI began to browse around early. I had a mind
to see something of this world, and I ran away from home before I was
twelve. Rustled for myself ever since.â€ 

â€œRan away?â€  Johnny looked hopeful. â€œWhat for?â€ 

â€œCouldnâ€™t make it go with my old man, and didnâ€™t take to farming. There
were plenty of boys at home. I wasnâ€™t missed.â€ 

Thea wriggled down in the hot sand and rested her chin on her arm.
â€œTell Johnny about the melons, Ray, please do!â€ 

Rayâ€™s solid, sunburned cheeks grew a shade redder, and he looked
reproachfully at Thea. â€œYouâ€™re stuck on that story, kid. You like to
get the laugh on me, donâ€™t you? That was the finishing split I had with
my old man, John. He had a claim along the creek, not far from Denver,
and raised a little garden stuff for market. One day he had a load of
melons and he decided to take â€™em to town and sell â€™em along the
street, and he made me go along and drive for him. Denver wasnâ€™t the
queen city it is now, by any means, but it seemed a terrible big place
to me; and when we got there, if he didnâ€™t make me drive right up
Capitol Hill! Pap got out and stopped at folkses houses to ask if they
didnâ€™t want to buy any melons, and I was to drive along slow. The
farther I went the madder I got, but I was trying to look unconscious,
when the end-gate came loose and one of the melons fell out and
squashed. Just then a swell girl, all dressed up, comes out of one of
the big houses and calls out, â€˜Hello, boy, youâ€™re losing your melons!â€™
Some dudes on the other side of the street took their hats off to her
and began to laugh. I couldnâ€™t stand it any longer. I grabbed the whip
and lit into that team, and they tore up the hill like jack-rabbits,
them damned melons bouncing out the back every jump, the old man
cussinâ€™ anâ€™ yellinâ€™ behind and everybody laughinâ€™. I never looked
behind, but the whole of Capitol Hill must have been a mess with them
squashed melons. I didnâ€™t stop the team till I got out of sight of
town. Then I pulled up anâ€™ left â€™em with a rancher I was acquainted
with, and I never went home to get the lickinâ€™ that was waitinâ€™ for me.
I expect itâ€™s waitinâ€™ for me yet.â€ 

Thea rolled over in the sand. â€œOh, I wish I could have seen those
melons fly, Ray! Iâ€™ll never see anything as funny as that. Now, tell
Johnny about your first job.â€ 

Ray had a collection of good stories. He was observant, truthful, and
kindlyâ€”perhaps the chief requisites in a good story-teller.
Occasionally he used newspaper phrases, conscientiously learned in his
efforts at self-instruction, but when he talked naturally he was always
worth listening to. Never having had any schooling to speak of, he had,
almost from the time he first ran away, tried to make good his loss. As
a sheep-herder he had worried an old grammar to tatters, and read
instructive books with the help of a pocket dictionary. By the light of
many camp-fires he had pondered upon Prescottâ€™s histories, and the
works of Washington Irving, which he bought at a high price from a
book-agent. Mathematics and physics were easy for him, but general
culture came hard, and he was determined to get it. Ray was a
freethinker, and inconsistently believed himself damned for being one.
When he was braking, down on the Santa FÃ©, at the end of his run he
used to climb into the upper bunk of the caboose, while a noisy gang
played poker about the stove below him, and by the roof-lamp read
Robert Ingersollâ€™s speeches and â€œThe Age of Reason.â€ 

Ray was a loyal-hearted fellow, and it had cost him a great deal to
give up his God. He was one of the stepchildren of Fortune, and he had
very little to show for all his hard work; the other fellow always got
the best of it. He had come in too late, or too early, on several
schemes that had made money. He brought with him from all his
wanderings a good deal of information (more or less correct in itself,
but unrelated, and therefore misleading), a high standard of personal
honor, a sentimental veneration for all women, bad as well as good, and
a bitter hatred of Englishmen. Thea often thought that the nicest thing
about Ray was his love for Mexico and the Mexicans, who had been kind
to him when he drifted, a homeless boy, over the border. In Mexico, Ray
was SeÃ±or Ken-Ã¡y-dy, and when he answered to that name he was somehow a
different fellow. He spoke Spanish fluently, and the sunny warmth of
that tongue kept him from being quite as hard as his chin, or as narrow
as his popular science.

While Ray was smoking his cigar, he and Johnny fell to talking about
the great fortunes that had been made in the Southwest, and about
fellows they knew who had â€œstruck it rich.â€ 

â€œI guess you been in on some big deals down there?â€  Johnny asked
trustfully.

Ray smiled and shook his head. â€œIâ€™ve been out on some, John. Iâ€™ve never
been exactly in on any. So far, Iâ€™ve either held on too long or let go
too soon. But mineâ€™s coming to me, all right.â€  Ray looked reflective.
He leaned back in the shadow and dug out a rest for his elbow in the
sand. â€œThe narrowest escape I ever had, was in the Bridal Chamber. If I
hadnâ€™t let go there, it would have made me rich. That was a close
call.â€ 

Johnny looked delighted. â€œYou donâ€™ say! She was silver mine, I guess?â€ 

â€œI guess she was! Down at Lake Valley. I put up a few hundred for the
prospector, and he gave me a bunch of stock. Before weâ€™d got anything
out of it, my brother-in-law died of the fever in Cuba. My sister was
beside herself to get his body back to Colorado to bury him. Seemed
foolish to me, but sheâ€™s the only sister I got. Itâ€™s expensive for dead
folks to travel, and I had to sell my stock in the mine to raise the
money to get Elmer on the move. Two months afterward, the boys struck
that big pocket in the rock, full of virgin silver. They named her the
Bridal Chamber. It wasnâ€™t ore, you remember. It was pure, soft metal
you could have melted right down into dollars. The boys cut it out with
chisels. If old Elmer hadnâ€™t played that trick on me, Iâ€™d have been in
for about fifty thousand. That was a close call, Spanish.â€ 

â€œI recollecâ€™. When the pocket gone, the town go bust.â€ 

â€œYou bet. Higherâ€™n a kite. There was no vein, just a pocket in the rock
that had sometime or another got filled up with molten silver. Youâ€™d
think there would be more somewhere about, but _nada_. Thereâ€™s fools
digging holes in that mountain yet.â€ 

When Ray had finished his cigar, Johnny took his mandolin and began
Kennedyâ€™s favorite, â€œUltimo Amor.â€  It was now three oâ€™clock in the
afternoon, the hottest hour in the day. The narrow shelf of shadow had
widened until the floor of the amphitheater was marked off in two
halves, one glittering yellow, and one purple. The little boys had come
back and were making a robbersâ€™ cave to enact the bold deeds of Pedro
the bandit. Johnny, stretched gracefully on the sand, passed from
â€œUltimo Amorâ€  to â€œFluvia de Oro,â€  and then to â€œNoches de Algeria,â€ 
playing languidly.

Every one was busy with his own thoughts. Mrs. Tellamantez was thinking
of the square in the little town in which she was born; of the white
church steps, with people genuflecting as they passed, and the
round-topped acacia trees, and the band playing in the plaza. Ray
Kennedy was thinking of the future, dreaming the large Western dream of
easy money, of a fortune kicked up somewhere in the hills,â€”an oil well,
a gold mine, a ledge of copper. He always told himself, when he
accepted a cigar from a newly married railroad man, that he knew enough
not to marry until he had found his ideal, and could keep her like a
queen. He believed that in the yellow head over there in the sand he
had found his ideal, and that by the time she was old enough to marry,
he would be able to keep her like a queen. He would kick it up from
somewhere, when he got loose from the railroad.

Thea, stirred by tales of adventure, of the Grand Canyon and Death
Valley, was recalling a great adventure of her own. Early in the summer
her father had been invited to conduct a reunion of old frontiersmen,
up in Wyoming, near Laramie, and he took Thea along with him to play
the organ and sing patriotic songs. There they stayed at the house of
an old ranchman who told them about a ridge up in the hills called
Laramie Plain, where the wagon-trails of the Forty-niners and the
Mormons were still visible. The old man even volunteered to take Mr.
Kronborg up into the hills to see this place, though it was a very long
drive to make in one day. Thea had begged frantically to go along, and
the old rancher, flattered by her rapt attention to his stories, had
interceded for her.

They set out from Laramie before daylight, behind a strong team of
mules. All the way there was much talk of the Forty-niners. The old
rancher had been a teamster in a freight train that used to crawl back
and forth across the plains between Omaha and Cherry Creek, as Denver
was then called, and he had met many a wagon train bound for
California. He told of Indians and buffalo, thirst and slaughter,
wanderings in snowstorms, and lonely graves in the desert.

The road they followed was a wild and beautiful one. It led up and up,
by granite rocks and stunted pines, around deep ravines and echoing
gorges. The top of the ridge, when they reached it, was a great flat
plain, strewn with white boulders, with the wind howling over it. There
was not one trail, as Thea had expected; there were a score; deep
furrows, cut in the earth by heavy wagon wheels, and now grown over
with dry, whitish grass. The furrows ran side by side; when one trail
had been worn too deep, the next party had abandoned it and made a new
trail to the right or left. They were, indeed, only old wagon ruts,
running east and west, and grown over with grass. But as Thea ran about
among the white stones, her skirts blowing this way and that, the wind
brought to her eyes tears that might have come anyway. The old rancher
picked up an iron ox-shoe from one of the furrows and gave it to her
for a keepsake. To the west one could see range after range of blue
mountains, and at last the snowy range, with its white, windy peaks,
the clouds caught here and there on their spurs. Again and again Thea
had to hide her face from the cold for a moment. The wind never slept
on this plain, the old man said. Every little while eagles flew over.

Coming up from Laramie, the old man had told them that he was in
Brownsville, Nebraska, when the first telegraph wires were put across
the Missouri River, and that the first message that ever crossed the
river was â€œWestward the course of Empire takes its way.â€  He had been in
the room when the instrument began to click, and all the men there had,
without thinking what they were doing, taken off their hats, waiting
bareheaded to hear the message translated. Thea remembered that message
when she sighted down the wagon tracks toward the blue mountains. She
told herself she would never, never forget it. The spirit of human
courage seemed to live up there with the eagles. For long after, when
she was moved by a Fourth-of-July oration, or a band, or a circus
parade, she was apt to remember that windy ridge.

To-day she went to sleep while she was thinking about it. When Ray
wakened her, the horses were hitched to the wagon and Gunner and Axel
were begging for a place on the front seat. The air had cooled, the sun
was setting, and the desert was on fire. Thea contentedly took the back
seat with Mrs. Tellamantez. As they drove homeward the stars began to
come out, pale yellow in a yellow sky, and Ray and Johnny began to sing
one of those railroad ditties that are usually born on the Southern
Pacific and run the length of the Santa FÃ© and the â€œQâ€  system before
they die to give place to a new one. This was a song about a Greaser
dance, the refrain being something like this:â€”

â€œPedrÃ³, PedrÃ³, swing high, swing low,
And itâ€™s allamand left again;
For thereâ€™s boys thatâ€™s bold and thereâ€™s some thatâ€™s cold,
But the gÃ³ld boys come from Spain,
Oh, the gÃ³ld boys come from Spain!â€ 




VIII


Winter was long in coming that year. Throughout October the days were
bathed in sunlight and the air was clear as crystal. The town kept its
cheerful summer aspect, the desert glistened with light, the sand hills
every day went through magical changes of color. The scarlet sage
bloomed late in the front yards, the cottonwood leaves were bright gold
long before they fell, and it was not until November that the green on
the tamarisks began to cloud and fade. There was a flurry of snow about
Thanksgiving, and then December came on warm and clear.

Thea had three music pupils now, little girls whose mothers declared
that Professor Wunsch was â€œmuch too severe.â€  They took their lessons on
Saturday, and this, of course, cut down her time for play. She did not
really mind this because she was allowed to use the moneyâ€”her pupils
paid her twenty-five cents a lessonâ€”to fit up a little room for herself
upstairs in the half-story. It was the end room of the wing, and was
not plastered, but was snugly lined with soft pine. The ceiling was so
low that a grown person could reach it with the palm of the hand, and
it sloped down on either side. There was only one window, but it was a
double one and went to the floor. In October, while the days were still
warm, Thea and Tillie papered the room, walls and ceiling in the same
paper, small red and brown roses on a yellowish ground. Thea bought a
brown cotton carpet, and her big brother, Gus, put it down for her one
Sunday. She made white cheesecloth curtains and hung them on a tape.
Her mother gave her an old walnut dresser with a broken mirror, and she
had her own dumpy walnut single bed, and a blue washbowl and pitcher
which she had drawn at a church fair lottery. At the head of her bed
she had a tall round wooden hat-crate, from the clothing store. This,
standing on end and draped with cretonne, made a fairly steady table
for her lantern. She was not allowed to take a lamp upstairs, so Ray
Kennedy gave her a railroad lantern by which she could read at night.

In winter this loft room of Theaâ€™s was bitterly cold, but against her
motherâ€™s adviceâ€”and Tillieâ€™sâ€”she always left her window open a little
way. Mrs. Kronborg declared that she â€œhad no patience with American
physiology,â€  though the lessons about the injurious effects of alcohol
and tobacco were well enough for the boys. Thea asked Dr. Archie about
the window, and he told her that a girl who sang must always have
plenty of fresh air, or her voice would get husky, and that the cold
would harden her throat. The important thing, he said, was to keep your
feet warm. On very cold nights Thea always put a brick in the oven
after supper, and when she went upstairs she wrapped it in an old
flannel petticoat and put it in her bed. The boys, who would never heat
bricks for themselves, sometimes carried off Theaâ€™s, and thought it a
good joke to get ahead of her.

When Thea first plunged in between her red blankets, the cold sometimes
kept her awake for a good while, and she comforted herself by
remembering all she could of â€œPolar Explorations,â€  a fat, calf-bound
volume her father had bought from a book-agent, and by thinking about
the members of Greelyâ€™s party: how they lay in their frozen
sleeping-bags, each man hoarding the warmth of his own body and trying
to make it last as long as possible against the on-coming cold that
would be everlasting. After half an hour or so, a warm wave crept over
her body and round, sturdy legs; she glowed like a little stove with
the warmth of her own blood, and the heavy quilts and red blankets grew
warm wherever they touched her, though her breath sometimes froze on
the coverlid. Before daylight, her internal fires went down a little,
and she often wakened to find herself drawn up into a tight ball,
somewhat stiff in the legs. But that made it all the easier to get up.

The acquisition of this room was the beginning of a new era in Theaâ€™s
life. It was one of the most important things that ever happened to
her. Hitherto, except in summer, when she could be out of doors, she
had lived in constant turmoil; the family, the day school, the
Sunday-School. The clamor about her drowned the voice within herself.
In the end of the wing, separated from the other upstairs
sleeping-rooms by a long, cold, unfinished lumber room, her mind worked
better. She thought things out more clearly. Pleasant plans and ideas
occurred to her which had never come before. She had certain thoughts
which were like companions, ideas which were like older and wiser
friends. She left them there in the morning, when she finished dressing
in the cold, and at night, when she came up with her lantern and shut
the door after a busy day, she found them awaiting her. There was no
possible way of heating the room, but that was fortunate, for otherwise
it would have been occupied by one of her older brothers.

From the time when she moved up into the wing, Thea began to live a
double life. During the day, when the hours were full of tasks, she was
one of the Kronborg children, but at night she was a different person.
On Friday and Saturday nights she always read for a long while after
she was in bed. She had no clock, and there was no one to nag her.

Ray Kennedy, on his way from the depot to his boardinghouse, often
looked up and saw Theaâ€™s light burning when the rest of the house was
dark, and felt cheered as by a friendly greeting. He was a faithful
soul, and many disappointments had not changed his nature. He was
still, at heart, the same boy who, when he was sixteen, had settled
down to freeze with his sheep in a Wyoming blizzard, and had been
rescued only to play the losing game of fidelity to other charges.

Ray had no very clear idea of what might be going on in Theaâ€™s head,
but he knew that something was. He used to remark to Spanish Johnny,
â€œThat girl is developing something fine.â€  Thea was patient with Ray,
even in regard to the liberties he took with her name. Outside the
family, every one in Moonstone, except Wunsch and Dr. Archie, called
her â€œThee-a,â€  but this seemed cold and distant to Ray, so he called her
â€œThee.â€  Once, in a moment of exasperation, Thea asked him why he did
this, and he explained that he once had a chum, Theodore, whose name
was always abbreviated thus, and that since he was killed down on the
Santa FÃ©, it seemed natural to call somebody â€œThee.â€  Thea sighed and
submitted. She was always helpless before homely sentiment and usually
changed the subject.

It was the custom for each of the different Sunday Schools in Moonstone
to give a concert on Christmas Eve. But this year all the churches were
to unite and give, as was announced from the pulpits, â€œa semi-sacred
concert of picked talentâ€  at the opera house. The Moonstone Orchestra,
under the direction of Professor Wunsch, was to play, and the most
talented members of each Sunday School were to take part in the
programme. Thea was put down by the committee â€œfor instrumental.â€  This
made her indignant, for the vocal numbers were always more popular.
Thea went to the president of the committee and demanded hotly if her
rival, Lily Fisher, were going to sing. The president was a big,
florid, powdered woman, a fierce W.C.T.U. worker, one of Theaâ€™s natural
enemies. Her name was Johnson; her husband kept the livery stable, and
she was called Mrs. Livery Johnson, to distinguish her from other
families of the same surname. Mrs. Johnson was a prominent Baptist, and
Lily Fisher was the Baptist prodigy. There was a not very Christian
rivalry between the Baptist Church and Mr. Kronborgâ€™s church.

When Thea asked Mrs. Johnson whether her rival was to be allowed to
sing, Mrs. Johnson, with an eagerness which told how she had waited for
this moment, replied that â€œLily was going to recite to be obliging, and
to give other children a chance to sing.â€  As she delivered this thrust,
her eyes glittered more than the Ancient Marinerâ€™s, Thea thought. Mrs.
Johnson disapproved of the way in which Thea was being brought up, of a
child whose chosen associates were Mexicans and sinners, and who was,
as she pointedly put it, â€œbold with men.â€  She so enjoyed an opportunity
to rebuke Thea, that, tightly corseted as she was, she could scarcely
control her breathing, and her lace and her gold watch chain rose and
fell â€œwith short, uneasy motion.â€  Frowning, Thea turned away and walked
slowly homeward. She suspected guile. Lily Fisher was the most stuck-up
doll in the world, and it was certainly not like her to recite to be
obliging. Nobody who could sing ever recited, because the warmest
applause always went to the singers.

However, when the programme was printed in the Moonstone _Gleam_, there
it was: â€œInstrumental solo, Thea Kronborg. Recitation, Lily Fisher.â€ 

Because his orchestra was to play for the concert, Mr. Wunsch imagined
that he had been put in charge of the music, and he became arrogant. He
insisted that Thea should play a â€œBalladeâ€  by Reinecke. When Thea
consulted her mother, Mrs. Kronborg agreed with her that the â€œBalladeâ€ 
would â€œnever takeâ€  with a Moonstone audience. She advised Thea to play
â€œsomething with variations,â€  or, at least, â€œThe Invitation to the
Dance.â€ 

â€œIt makes no matter what they like,â€  Wunsch replied to Theaâ€™s
entreaties. â€œIt is time already that they learn something.â€ 

Theaâ€™s fighting powers had been impaired by an ulcerated tooth and
consequent loss of sleep, so she gave in. She finally had the molar
pulled, though it was a second tooth and should have been saved. The
dentist was a clumsy, ignorant country boy, and Mr. Kronborg would not
hear of Dr. Archieâ€™s taking Thea to a dentist in Denver, though Ray
Kennedy said he could get a pass for her. What with the pain of the
tooth, and family discussions about it, with trying to make Christmas
presents and to keep up her school work and practicing, and giving
lessons on Saturdays, Thea was fairly worn out.

On Christmas Eve she was nervous and excited. It was the first time she
had ever played in the opera house, and she had never before had to
face so many people. Wunsch would not let her play with her notes, and
she was afraid of forgetting. Before the concert began, all the
participants had to assemble on the stage and sit there to be looked
at. Thea wore her white summer dress and a blue sash, but Lily Fisher
had a new pink silk, trimmed with white swansdown.

The hall was packed. It seemed as if every one in Moonstone was there,
even Mrs. Kohler, in her hood, and old Fritz. The seats were wooden
kitchen chairs, numbered, and nailed to long planks which held them
together in rows. As the floor was not raised, the chairs were all on
the same level. The more interested persons in the audience peered over
the heads of the people in front of them to get a good view of the
stage. From the platform Thea picked out many friendly faces. There was
Dr. Archie, who never went to church entertainments; there was the
friendly jeweler who ordered her music for her,â€”he sold accordions and
guitars as well as watches,â€”and the druggist who often lent her books,
and her favorite teacher from the school. There was Ray Kennedy, with a
party of freshly barbered railroad men he had brought along with him.
There was Mrs. Kronborg with all the children, even Thor, who had been
brought out in a new white plush coat. At the back of the hall sat a
little group of Mexicans, and among them Thea caught the gleam of
Spanish Johnnyâ€™s white teeth, and of Mrs. Tellamantezâ€™s lustrous,
smoothly coiled black hair.

After the orchestra played â€œSelections from Erminie,â€  and the Baptist
preacher made a long prayer, Tillie Kronborg came on with a highly
colored recitation, â€œThe Polish Boy.â€  When it was over every one
breathed more freely. No committee had the courage to leave Tillie off
a programme. She was accepted as a trying feature of every
entertainment. The Progressive Euchre Club was the only social
organization in the town that entirely escaped Tillie. After Tillie sat
down, the Ladiesâ€™ Quartette sang, â€œBeloved, it is Night,â€  and then it
was Theaâ€™s turn.

The â€œBalladeâ€  took ten minutes, which was five minutes too long. The
audience grew restive and fell to whispering. Thea could hear Mrs.
Livery Johnsonâ€™s bracelets jangling as she fanned herself, and she
could hear her fatherâ€™s nervous, ministerial cough. Thor behaved better
than any one else. When Thea bowed and returned to her seat at the back
of the stage there was the usual applause, but it was vigorous only
from the back of the house where the Mexicans sat, and from Ray
Kennedyâ€™s _claqueurs_. Any one could see that a good-natured audience
had been bored.

Because Mr. Kronborgâ€™s sister was on the programme, it had also been
necessary to ask the Baptist preacherâ€™s wifeâ€™s cousin to sing. She was
a â€œdeep altoâ€  from McCook, and she sang, â€œThy Sentinel Am I.â€  After her
came Lily Fisher. Theaâ€™s rival was also a blonde, but her hair was much
heavier than Theaâ€™s, and fell in long round curls over her shoulders.
She was the angel-child of the Baptists, and looked exactly like the
beautiful children on soap calendars. Her pink-and-white face, her set
smile of innocence, were surely born of a color-press. She had long,
drooping eyelashes, a little pursed-up mouth, and narrow, pointed
teeth, like a squirrelâ€™s.

Lily began:â€”

â€œ_Rock of Ages, cleft for me_, carelessly the maiden sang.â€ 


Thea drew a long breath. That was the game; it was a recitation and a
song in one. Lily trailed the hymn through half a dozen verses with
great effect. The Baptist preacher had announced at the beginning of
the concert that â€œowing to the length of the programme, there would be
no encores.â€  But the applause which followed Lily to her seat was such
an unmistakable expression of enthusiasm that Thea had to admit Lily
was justified in going back. She was attended this time by Mrs. Livery
Johnson herself, crimson with triumph and gleaming-eyed, nervously
rolling and unrolling a sheet of music. She took off her bracelets and
played Lilyâ€™s accompaniment. Lily had the effrontery to come out with,
â€œShe sang the song of Home, Sweet Home, the song that touched my
heart.â€  But this did not surprise Thea; as Ray said later in the
evening, â€œthe cards had been stacked against her from the beginning.â€ 
The next issue of the _Gleam_ correctly stated that â€œunquestionably the
honors of the evening must be accorded to Miss Lily Fisher.â€  The
Baptists had everything their own way.

After the concert Ray Kennedy joined the Kronborgsâ€™ party and walked
home with them. Thea was grateful for his silent sympathy, even while
it irritated her. She inwardly vowed that she would never take another
lesson from old Wunsch. She wished that her father would not keep
cheerfully singing, â€œWhen Shepherds Watched,â€  as he marched ahead,
carrying Thor. She felt that silence would become the Kronborgs for a
while. As a family, they somehow seemed a little ridiculous, trooping
along in the starlight. There were so many of them, for one thing. Then
Tillie was so absurd. She was giggling and talking to Anna just as if
she had not made, as even Mrs. Kronborg admitted, an exhibition of
herself.

When they got home, Ray took a box from his overcoat pocket and slipped
it into Theaâ€™s hand as he said goodnight. They all hurried in to the
glowing stove in the parlor. The sleepy children were sent to bed. Mrs.
Kronborg and Anna stayed up to fill the stockings.

â€œI guess youâ€™re tired, Thea. You neednâ€™t stay up.â€  Mrs. Kronborgâ€™s
clear and seemingly indifferent eye usually measured Thea pretty
accurately.

Thea hesitated. She glanced at the presents laid out on the dining-room
table, but they looked unattractive. Even the brown plush monkey she
had bought for Thor with such enthusiasm seemed to have lost his wise
and humorous expression. She murmured, â€œAll right,â€  to her mother, lit
her lantern, and went upstairs.

Rayâ€™s box contained a hand-painted white satin fan, with pond liliesâ€”an
unfortunate reminder. Thea smiled grimly and tossed it into her upper
drawer. She was not to be consoled by toys. She undressed quickly and
stood for some time in the cold, frowning in the broken looking glass
at her flaxen pig-tails, at her white neck and arms. Her own broad,
resolute face set its chin at her, her eyes flashed into her own
defiantly. Lily Fisher was pretty, and she was willing to be just as
big a fool as people wanted her to be. Very well; Thea Kronborg wasnâ€™t.
She would rather be hated than be stupid, any day. She popped into bed
and read stubbornly at a queer paper book the drug-store man had given
her because he couldnâ€™t sell it. She had trained herself to put her
mind on what she was doing, otherwise she would have come to grief with
her complicated daily schedule. She read, as intently as if she had not
been flushed with anger, the strange â€œMusical Memoriesâ€  of the Reverend
H. R. Haweis. At last she blew out the lantern and went to sleep. She
had many curious dreams that night. In one of them Mrs. Tellamantez
held her shell to Theaâ€™s ear, and she heard the roaring, as before, and
distant voices calling, â€œLily Fisher! Lily Fisher!â€ 




IX


Mr. Kronborg considered Thea a remarkable child; but so were all his
children remarkable. If one of the business men downtown remarked to
him that he â€œhad a mighty bright little girl, there,â€  he admitted it,
and at once began to explain what a â€œlong head for businessâ€  his son
Gus had, or that Charley was â€œa natural electrician,â€  and had put in a
telephone from the house to the preacherâ€™s study behind the church.

Mrs. Kronborg watched her daughter thoughtfully. She found her more
interesting than her other children, and she took her more seriously,
without thinking much about why she did so. The other children had to
be guided, directed, kept from conflicting with one another. Charley
and Gus were likely to want the same thing, and to quarrel about it.
Anna often demanded unreasonable service from her older brothers; that
they should sit up until after midnight to bring her home from parties
when she did not like the youth who had offered himself as her escort;
or that they should drive twelve miles into the country, on a winter
night, to take her to a ranch dance, after they had been working hard
all day. Gunner often got bored with his own clothes or stilts or sled,
and wanted Axelâ€™s. But Thea, from the time she was a little thing, had
her own routine. She kept out of every oneâ€™s way, and was hard to
manage only when the other children interfered with her. Then there was
trouble indeed: bursts of temper which used to alarm Mrs. Kronborg.
â€œYou ought to know enough to let Thea alone. She lets you alone,â€  she
often said to the other children.

One may have staunch friends in oneâ€™s own family, but one seldom has
admirers. Thea, however, had one in the person of her addle-pated aunt,
Tillie Kronborg. In older countries, where dress and opinions and
manners are not so thoroughly standardized as in our own West, there is
a belief that people who are foolish about the more obvious things of
life are apt to have peculiar insight into what lies beyond the
obvious. The old woman who can never learn not to put the kerosene can
on the stove, may yet be able to tell fortunes, to persuade a backward
child to grow, to cure warts, or to tell people what to do with a young
girl who has gone melancholy. Tillieâ€™s mind was a curious machine; when
she was awake it went round like a wheel when the belt has slipped off,
and when she was asleep she dreamed follies. But she had intuitions.
She knew, for instance, that Thea was different from the other
Kronborgs, worthy though they all were. Her romantic imagination found
possibilities in her niece. When she was sweeping or ironing, or
turning the ice-cream freezer at a furious rate, she often built up
brilliant futures for Thea, adapting freely the latest novel she had
read.

Tillie made enemies for her niece among the church people because, at
sewing societies and church suppers, she sometimes spoke vauntingly,
with a toss of her head, just as if Theaâ€™s â€œwonderfulnessâ€  were an
accepted fact in Moonstone, like Mrs. Archieâ€™s stinginess, or Mrs.
Livery Johnsonâ€™s duplicity. People declared that, on this subject,
Tillie made them tired.

Tillie belonged to a dramatic club that once a year performed in the
Moonstone Opera House such plays as â€œAmong the Breakers,â€  and â€œThe
Veteran of 1812.â€  Tillie played character parts, the flirtatious old
maid or the spiteful _intrigante_. She used to study her parts up in
the attic at home. While she was committing the lines, she got Gunner
or Anna to hold the book for her, but when she began â€œto bring out the
expression,â€  as she said, she used, very timorously, to ask Thea to
hold the book. Thea was usuallyâ€”not alwaysâ€”agreeable about it. Her
mother had told her that, since she had some influence with Tillie, it
would be a good thing for them all if she could tone her down a shade
and â€œkeep her from taking on any worse than need be.â€  Thea would sit on
the foot of Tillieâ€™s bed, her feet tucked under her, and stare at the
silly text. â€œI wouldnâ€™t make so much fuss, there, Tillie,â€  she would
remark occasionally; â€œI donâ€™t see the point in itâ€ ; or, â€œWhat do you
pitch your voice so high for? It donâ€™t carry half as well.â€ 

â€œI donâ€™t see how it comes Thea is so patient with Tillie,â€  Mrs.
Kronborg more than once remarked to her husband. â€œShe ainâ€™t patient
with most people, but it seems like sheâ€™s got a peculiar patience for
Tillie.â€ 

Tillie always coaxed Thea to go â€œbehind the scenesâ€  with her when the
club presented a play, and help her with her make-up. Thea hated it,
but she always went. She felt as if she had to do it. There was
something in Tillieâ€™s adoration of her that compelled her. There was no
family impropriety that Thea was so much ashamed of as Tillieâ€™s
â€œactingâ€  and yet she was always being dragged in to assist her. Tillie
simply had her, there. She didnâ€™t know why, but it was so. There was a
string in her somewhere that Tillie could pull; a sense of obligation
to Tillieâ€™s misguided aspirations. The saloon-keepers had some such
feeling of responsibility toward Spanish Johnny.

The dramatic club was the pride of Tillieâ€™s heart, and her enthusiasm
was the principal factor in keeping it together. Sick or well, Tillie
always attended rehearsals, and was always urging the young people, who
took rehearsals lightly, to â€œstop fooling and begin now.â€  The young
menâ€”bank clerks, grocery clerks, insurance agentsâ€”played tricks,
laughed at Tillie, and â€œput it up on each otherâ€  about seeing her home;
but they often went to tiresome rehearsals just to oblige her. They
were good-natured young fellows. Their trainer and stage-manager was
young Upping, the jeweler who ordered Theaâ€™s music for her.

Though barely thirty, he had followed half a dozen professions, and had
once been a violinist in the orchestra of the Andrews Opera Company,
then well known in little towns throughout Colorado and Nebraska.

By one amazing indiscretion Tillie very nearly lost her hold upon the
Moonstone Drama Club. The club had decided to put on â€œThe Drummer Boy
of Shiloh,â€  a very ambitious undertaking because of the many supers
needed and the scenic difficulties of the act which took place in
Andersonville Prison. The members of the club consulted together in
Tillieâ€™s absence as to who should play the part of the drummer boy. It
must be taken by a very young person, and village boys of that age are
self-conscious and are not apt at memorizing. The part was a long one,
and clearly it must be given to a girl. Some members of the club
suggested Thea Kronborg, others advocated Lily Fisher. Lilyâ€™s partisans
urged that she was much prettier than Thea, and had a much â€œsweeter
disposition.â€  Nobody denied these facts. But there was nothing in the
least boyish about Lily, and she sang all songs and played all parts
alike. Lilyâ€™s simper was popular, but it seemed not quite the right
thing for the heroic drummer boy.

Upping, the trainer, talked to one and another: â€œLilyâ€™s all right for
girl parts,â€  he insisted, â€œbut youâ€™ve got to get a girl with some
ginger in her for this. Theaâ€™s got the voice, too. When she sings,
â€˜Just Before the Battle, Mother,â€™ sheâ€™ll bring down the house.â€ 

When all the members of the club had been privately consulted, they
announced their decision to Tillie at the first regular meeting that
was called to cast the parts. They expected Tillie to be overcome with
joy, but, on the contrary, she seemed embarrassed. â€œIâ€™m afraid Thea
hasnâ€™t got time for that,â€  she said jerkily. â€œShe is always so busy
with her music. Guess youâ€™ll have to get somebody else.â€ 

The club lifted its eyebrows. Several of Lily Fisherâ€™s friends coughed.
Mr. Upping flushed. The stout woman who always played the injured wife
called Tillieâ€™s attention to the fact that this would be a fine
opportunity for her niece to show what she could do. Her tone was
condescending.

Tillie threw up her head and laughed; there was something sharp and
wild about Tillieâ€™s laughâ€”when it was not a giggle. â€œOh, I guess Thea
hasnâ€™t got time to do any showing off. Her time to show off ainâ€™t come
yet. I expect sheâ€™ll make us all sit up when it does. No use asking her
to take the part. Sheâ€™d turn her nose up at it. I guess theyâ€™d be glad
to get her in the Denver Dramatics, if they could.â€ 

The company broke up into groups and expressed their amazement. Of
course all Swedes were conceited, but they would never have believed
that all the conceit of all the Swedes put together would reach such a
pitch as this. They confided to each other that Tillie was â€œjust a
little off, on the subject of her niece,â€  and agreed that it would be
as well not to excite her further. Tillie got a cold reception at
rehearsals for a long while afterward, and Thea had a crop of new
enemies without even knowing it.

Wunsch and old Fritz and Spanish Johnny celebrated Christmas together,
so riotously that Wunsch was unable to give Thea her lesson the next
day. In the middle of the vacation week Thea went to the Kohlersâ€™
through a soft, beautiful snowstorm. The air was a tender blue-gray,
like the color on the doves that flew in and out of the white
dove-house on the post in the Kohlersâ€™ garden. The sand hills looked
dim and sleepy. The tamarisk hedge was full of snow, like a foam of
blossoms drifted over it. When Thea opened the gate, old Mrs. Kohler
was just coming in from the chicken yard, with five fresh eggs in her
apron and a pair of old top-boots on her feet. She called Thea to come
and look at a bantam egg, which she held up proudly. Her bantam hens
were remiss in zeal, and she was always delighted when they
accomplished anything. She took Thea into the sitting-room, very warm
and smelling of food, and brought her a plateful of little Christmas
cakes, made according to old and hallowed formulae, and put them before
her while she warmed her feet. Then she went to the door of the kitchen
stairs and called: â€œHerr Wunsch, Herr Wunsch!â€ 

Wunsch came down wearing an old wadded jacket, with a velvet collar.
The brown silk was so worn that the wadding stuck out almost
everywhere. He avoided Theaâ€™s eyes when he came in, nodded without
speaking, and pointed directly to the piano stool. He was not so
insistent upon the scales as usual, and throughout the little sonata of
Mozartâ€™s she was studying, he remained languid and absent-minded. His
eyes looked very heavy, and he kept wiping them with one of the new
silk handkerchiefs Mrs. Kohler had given him for Christmas. When the
lesson was over he did not seem inclined to talk. Thea, loitering on
the stool, reached for a tattered book she had taken off the music-rest
when she sat down. It was a very old Leipsic edition of the piano score
of Gluckâ€™s â€œOrpheus.â€  She turned over the pages curiously.

â€œIs it nice?â€  she asked.

â€œIt is the most beautiful opera ever made,â€  Wunsch declared solemnly.
â€œYou know the story, eh? How, when she die, Orpheus went down below for
his wife?â€ 

â€œOh, yes, I know. I didnâ€™t know there was an opera about it, though. Do
people sing this now?â€ 

â€œ_Aber ja!_ What else? You like to try? See.â€  He drew her from the
stool and sat down at the piano. Turning over the leaves to the third
act, he handed the score to Thea. â€œListen, I play it through and you
get the _rhythmus. Eins, zwei, drei, vier_.â€  He played through Orpheusâ€™
lament, then pushed back his cuffs with awakening interest and nodded
at Thea. â€œNow, _vom blatt, mit mir_.â€ 

â€œAch, ich habe sie verloren,
Allâ€™ mein GlÃ¼ck ist nun dahin.â€ 


Wunsch sang the aria with much feeling. It was evidently one that was
very dear to him.

â€œ_Noch einmal_, alone, yourself.â€  He played the introductory measures,
then nodded at her vehemently, and she began:â€”

â€œAch, ich habe sie verloren.â€ 


When she finished, Wunsch nodded again. â€œ_SchÃ¶n_,â€  he muttered as he
finished the accompaniment softly. He dropped his hands on his knees
and looked up at Thea. â€œThat is very fine, eh? There is no such
beautiful melody in the world. You can take the book for one week and
learn something, to pass the time. It is good to knowâ€”always.
_Euridice, Euâ€”riâ€”diâ€”ce, weh dass ich auf Erden bin!_â€  he sang softly,
playing the melody with his right hand.

Thea, who was turning over the pages of the third act, stopped and
scowled at a passage. The old Germanâ€™s blurred eyes watched her
curiously.

â€œFor what do you look so, _immer?_â€  puckering up his own face. â€œYou see
something a little difficult, may-be, and you make such a face like it
was an enemy.â€ 

Thea laughed, disconcerted. â€œWell, difficult things are enemies, arenâ€™t
they? When you have to get them?â€ 

Wunsch lowered his head and threw it up as if he were butting
something. â€œNot at all! By no means.â€  He took the book from her and
looked at it. â€œYes, that is not so easy, there. This is an old book.
They do not print it so now any more, I think. They leave it out,
may-be. Only one woman could sing that good.â€ 

Thea looked at him in perplexity.

Wunsch went on. â€œIt is written for alto, you see. A woman sings the
part, and there was only one to sing that good in there. You
understand? Only one!â€  He glanced at her quickly and lifted his red
forefinger upright before her eyes.

Thea looked at the finger as if she were hypnotized. â€œOnly one?â€  she
asked breathlessly; her hands, hanging at her sides, were opening and
shutting rapidly.

Wunsch nodded and still held up that compelling finger. When he dropped
his hands, there was a look of satisfaction in his face.

â€œWas she very great?â€ 

Wunsch nodded.

â€œWas she beautiful?â€ 

â€œ_Aber gar nicht!_ Not at all. She was ugly; big mouth, big teeth, no
figure, nothing at all,â€  indicating a luxuriant bosom by sweeping his
hands over his chest. â€œA pole, a post! But for the voiceâ€”_ach!_ She
have something in there, behind the eyes,â€  tapping his temples.

Thea followed all his gesticulations intently. â€œWas she German?â€ 

â€œNo, _Spanisch_.â€  He looked down and frowned for a moment. â€œ_Ach_, I
tell you, she look like the Frau Tellamantez, some-thing. Long face,
long chin, and ugly al-so.â€ 

â€œDid she die a long while ago?â€ 

â€œDie? I think not. I never hear, anyhow. I guess she is alive somewhere
in the world; Paris, may-be. But old, of course. I hear her when I was
a youth. She is too old to sing now any more.â€ 

â€œWas she the greatest singer you ever heard?â€ 

Wunsch nodded gravely. â€œQuite so. She was the mostâ€”â€  he hunted for an
English word, lifted his hand over his head and snapped his fingers
noiselessly in the air, enunciating fiercely, â€œ_kÃ¼nst-ler-isch!_â€  The
word seemed to glitter in his uplifted hand, his voice was so full of
emotion.

Wunsch rose from the stool and began to button his wadded jacket,
preparing to return to his half-heated room in the loft. Thea
regretfully put on her cloak and hood and set out for home.

When Wunsch looked for his score late that afternoon, he found that
Thea had not forgotten to take it with her. He smiled his loose,
sarcastic smile, and thoughtfully rubbed his stubbly chin with his red
fingers. When Fritz came home in the early blue twilight the snow was
flying faster, Mrs. Kohler was cooking _Hasenpfeffer_ in the kitchen,
and the professor was seated at the piano, playing the Gluck, which he
knew by heart. Old Fritz took off his shoes quietly behind the stove
and lay down on the lounge before his masterpiece, where the firelight
was playing over the walls of Moscow. He listened, while the room grew
darker and the windows duller. Wunsch always came back to the same
thing:â€”

â€œAch, ich habe sie verloren,
...
Euridice, Euridice!â€ 


From time to time Fritz sighed softly. He, too, had lost a Euridice.

One Saturday, late in June, Thea arrived early for her lesson. As she
perched herself upon the piano stool,â€”a wobbly, old-fashioned thing
that worked on a creaky screw,â€”she gave Wunsch a side glance, smiling.
â€œYou must not be cross to me to-day. This is my birthday.â€ 

â€œSo?â€  he pointed to the keyboard.

After the lesson they went out to join Mrs. Kohler, who had asked Thea
to come early, so that she could stay and smell the linden bloom. It
was one of those still days of intense light, when every particle of
mica in the soil flashed like a little mirror, and the glare from the
plain below seemed more intense than the rays from above. The sand
ridges ran glittering gold out to where the mirage licked them up,
shining and steaming like a lake in the tropics. The sky looked like
blue lava, forever incapable of clouds,â€”a turquoise bowl that was the
lid of the desert. And yet within Mrs. Kohlerâ€™s green patch the water
dripped, the beds had all been hosed, and the air was fresh with
rapidly evaporating moisture.

The two symmetrical linden trees were the proudest things in the
garden. Their sweetness embalmed all the air. At every turn of the
paths,â€”whether one went to see the hollyhocks or the bleeding heart, or
to look at the purple morning-glories that ran over the
bean-poles,â€”wherever one went, the sweetness of the lindens struck one
afresh and one always came back to them. Under the round leaves, where
the waxen yellow blossoms hung, bevies of wild bees were buzzing. The
tamarisks were still pink, and the flower-beds were doing their best in
honor of the linden festival. The white dove-house was shining with a
fresh coat of paint, and the pigeons were crooning contentedly, flying
down often to drink at the drip from the water tank. Mrs. Kohler, who
was transplanting pansies, came up with her trowel and told Thea it was
lucky to have your birthday when the lindens were in bloom, and that
she must go and look at the sweet peas. Wunsch accompanied her, and as
they walked between the flower-beds he took Theaâ€™s hand.

â€œEs flÃ¼stern und sprechen die Blumen,â€ â€”


he muttered. â€œYou know that von Heine? _Im leuchtenden Sommermorgen?_â€ 
He looked down at Thea and softly pressed her hand.

â€œNo, I donâ€™t know it. What does _flÃ¼stern_ mean?â€ 

â€œ_FlÃ¼stern?_â€”to whisper. You must begin now to know such things. That
is necessary. How many birthdays?â€ 

â€œThirteen. Iâ€™m in my â€™teens now. But how can I know words like that? I
only know what you say at my lessons. They donâ€™t teach German at
school. How can I learn?â€ 

â€œIt is always possible to learn when one likes,â€  said Wunsch. His words
were peremptory, as usual, but his tone was mild, even confidential.
â€œThere is always a way. And if some day you are going to sing, it is
necessary to know well the German language.â€ 

Thea stooped over to pick a leaf of rosemary. How did Wunsch know that,
when the very roses on her wall-paper had never heard it? â€œBut am I
going to?â€  she asked, still stooping.

â€œThat is for you to say,â€  returned Wunsch coldly. â€œYou would better
marry some _Jacob_ here and keep the house for him, may-be? That is as
one desires.â€ 

Thea flashed up at him a clear, laughing look. â€œNo, I donâ€™t want to do
that. You know,â€  she brushed his coat sleeve quickly with her yellow
head. â€œOnly how can I learn anything here? Itâ€™s so far from Denver.â€ 

Wunschâ€™s loose lower lip curled in amusement. Then, as if he suddenly
remembered something, he spoke seriously. â€œNothing is far and nothing
is near, if one desires. The world is little, people are little, human
life is little. There is only one big thingâ€”desire. And before it, when
it is big, all is little. It brought Columbus across the sea in a
little boat, _und so weiter_.â€  Wunsch made a grimace, took his pupilâ€™s
hand and drew her toward the grape arbor. â€œHereafter I will more speak
to you in German. Now, sit down and I will teach you for your birthday
that little song. Ask me the words you do not know already. Now: _Im
leuchtenden Sommermorgen_.â€ 

Thea memorized quickly because she had the power of listening intently.
In a few moments she could repeat the eight lines for him. Wunsch
nodded encouragingly and they went out of the arbor into the sunlight
again. As they went up and down the gravel paths between the
flowerbeds, the white and yellow butterflies kept darting before them,
and the pigeons were washing their pink feet at the drip and crooning
in their husky bass. Over and over again Wunsch made her say the lines
to him. â€œYou see it is nothing. If you learn a great many of the
_Lieder_, you will know the German language already. _Weiter, nun_.â€  He
would incline his head gravely and listen.

â€œIm leuchtenden Sommermorgen
Gehâ€™ ich im Garten herum;
Es flÃ¼stern und sprechen die Blumen,
Ich aber, ich wandte stumm.

â€œEs flÃ¼stern und sprechen die Blumen
Und schauâ€™n mitleidig mich an:
â€˜Sei unserer Schwester nicht bÃ¶se,
Du trauriger, blasser Mann!â€™â€ 


(In the soft-shining summer morning
I wandered the garden within.
The flowers they whispered and murmured,
But I, I wandered dumb.

The flowers they whisper and murmur,
And me with compassion they scan:
â€œOh, be not harsh to our sister,
Thou sorrowful, death-pale man!â€ )


Wunsch had noticed before that when his pupil read anything in verse
the character of her voice changed altogether; it was no longer the
voice which spoke the speech of Moonstone. It was a soft, rich
contralto, and she read quietly; the feeling was in the voice itself,
not indicated by emphasis or change of pitch. She repeated the little
verses musically, like a song, and the entreaty of the flowers was even
softer than the rest, as the shy speech of flowers might be, and she
ended with the voice suspended, almost with a rising inflection. It was
a nature-voice, Wunsch told himself, breathed from the creature and
apart from language, like the sound of the wind in the trees, or the
murmur of water.

â€œWhat is it the flowers mean when they ask him not to be harsh to their
sister, eh?â€  he asked, looking down at her curiously and wrinkling his
dull red forehead.

Thea glanced at him in surprise. â€œI suppose he thinks they are asking
him not to be harsh to his sweetheartâ€”or some girl they remind him of.â€ 

â€œAnd why _trauriger, blasser Mann?_â€ 

They had come back to the grape arbor, and Thea picked out a sunny
place on the bench, where a tortoise-shell cat was stretched at full
length. She sat down, bending over the cat and teasing his whiskers.
â€œBecause he had been awake all night, thinking about her, wasnâ€™t it?
Maybe that was why he was up so early.â€ 

Wunsch shrugged his shoulders. â€œIf he think about her all night
already, why do you say the flowers remind him?â€ 

Thea looked up at him in perplexity. A flash of comprehension lit her
face and she smiled eagerly. â€œOh, I didnâ€™t mean â€˜remindâ€™ in that way! I
didnâ€™t mean they brought her to his mind! I meant it was only when he
came out in the morning, that she seemed to him like that,â€”like one of
the flowers.â€ 

â€œAnd before he came out, how did she seem?â€ 

This time it was Thea who shrugged her shoulders. The warm smile left
her face. She lifted her eyebrows in annoyance and looked off at the
sand hills.

Wunsch persisted. â€œWhy you not answer me?â€ 

â€œBecause it would be silly. You are just trying to make me say things.
It spoils things to ask questions.â€ 

Wunsch bowed mockingly; his smile was disagreeable. Suddenly his face
grew grave, grew fierce, indeed. He pulled himself up from his clumsy
stoop and folded his arms. â€œBut it is necessary to know if you know
some things. Some things cannot be taught. If you not know in the
beginning, you not know in the end. For a singer there must be
something in the inside from the beginning. I shall not be long in this
place, may-be, and I like to know. Yes,â€ â€”he ground his heel in the
gravel,â€”â€œyes, when you are barely six, you must know that already. That
is the beginning of all things; _der Geist, die Phantasie_. It must be
in the baby, when it makes its first cry, like _der Rhythmus_, or it is
not to be. You have some voice already, and if in the beginning, when
you are with things-to-play, you know that what you will not tell me,
then you can learn to sing, may-be.â€ 

Wunsch began to pace the arbor, rubbing his hands together. The dark
flush of his face had spread up under the iron-gray bristles on his
head. He was talking to himself, not to Thea. Insidious power of the
linden bloom! â€œOh, much you can learn! _Aber nicht die Americanischen
FrÃ¤ulein_. They have nothing inside them,â€  striking his chest with both
fists. â€œThey are like the ones in the _MÃ¤rchen_, a grinning face and
hollow in the insides. Something they can learn, oh, yes, may-be! But
the secretâ€”what make the rose to red, the sky to blue, the man to
loveâ€”_in der Brust, in der Brust_ it is, _und ohne dieses giebt es
keine Kunst, giebt es keine Kunst!_â€  He threw up his square hand and
shook it, all the fingers apart and wagging. Purple and breathless he
went out of the arbor and into the house, without saying good-bye.
These outbursts frightened Wunsch. They were always harbingers of ill.

Thea got her music-book and stole quietly out of the garden. She did
not go home, but wandered off into the sand dunes, where the prickly
pear was in blossom and the green lizards were racing each other in the
glittering light. She was shaken by a passionate excitement. She did
not altogether understand what Wunsch was talking about; and yet, in a
way she knew. She knew, of course, that there was something about her
that was different. But it was more like a friendly spirit than like
anything that was a part of herself. She thought everything to it, and
it answered her; happiness consisted of that backward and forward
movement of herself. The something came and went, she never knew how.
Sometimes she hunted for it and could not find it; again, she lifted
her eyes from a book, or stepped out of doors, or wakened in the
morning, and it was there,â€”under her cheek, it usually seemed to be, or
over her breast,â€”a kind of warm sureness. And when it was there,
everything was more interesting and beautiful, even people. When this
companion was with her, she could get the most wonderful things out of
Spanish Johnny, or Wunsch, or Dr. Archie.

On her thirteenth birthday she wandered for a long while about the sand
ridges, picking up crystals and looking into the yellow prickly-pear
blossoms with their thousand stamens. She looked at the sand hills
until she wished she _were_ a sand hill. And yet she knew that she was
going to leave them all behind some day. They would be changing all day
long, yellow and purple and lavender, and she would not be there. From
that day on, she felt there was a secret between her and Wunsch.
Together they had lifted a lid, pulled out a drawer, and looked at
something. They hid it away and never spoke of what they had seen; but
neither of them forgot it.




XII


One July night, when the moon was full, Dr. Archie was coming up from
the depot, restless and discontented, wishing there were something to
do. He carried his straw hat in his hand, and kept brushing his hair
back from his forehead with a purposeless, unsatisfied gesture. After
he passed Uncle Billy Beemerâ€™s cottonwood grove, the sidewalk ran out
of the shadow into the white moonlight and crossed the sand gully on
high posts, like a bridge. As the doctor approached this trestle, he
saw a white figure, and recognized Thea Kronborg. He quickened his pace
and she came to meet him.

â€œWhat are you doing out so late, my girl?â€  he asked as he took her
hand.

â€œOh, I donâ€™t know. What do people go to bed so early for? Iâ€™d like to
run along before the houses and screech at them. Isnâ€™t it glorious out
here?â€ 

The young doctor gave a melancholy laugh and pressed her hand.

â€œThink of it,â€  Thea snorted impatiently. â€œNobody up but us and the
rabbits! Iâ€™ve started up half a dozen of â€™em. Look at that little one
down there now,â€ â€”she stooped and pointed. In the gully below them there
was, indeed, a little rabbit with a white spot of a tail, crouching
down on the sand, quite motionless. It seemed to be lapping up the
moonlight like cream. On the other side of the walk, down in the ditch,
there was a patch of tall, rank sunflowers, their shaggy leaves white
with dust. The moon stood over the cottonwood grove. There was no wind,
and no sound but the wheezing of an engine down on the tracks.

â€œWell, we may as well watch the rabbits.â€  Dr. Archie sat down on the
sidewalk and let his feet hang over the edge. He pulled out a smooth
linen handkerchief that smelled of German cologne water. â€œWell, how
goes it? Working hard? You must know about all Wunsch can teach you by
this time.â€ 

Thea shook her head. â€œOh, no, I donâ€™t, Dr. Archie. Heâ€™s hard to get at,
but heâ€™s been a real musician in his time. Mother says she believes
heâ€™s forgotten more than the music-teachers down in Denver ever knew.â€ 

â€œIâ€™m afraid he wonâ€™t be around here much longer,â€  said Dr. Archie.
â€œHeâ€™s been making a tank of himself lately. Heâ€™ll be pulling his
freight one of these days. Thatâ€™s the way they do, you know. Iâ€™ll be
sorry on your account.â€  He paused and ran his fresh handkerchief over
his face. â€œWhat the deuce are we all here for anyway, Thea?â€  he said
abruptly.

â€œOn earth, you mean?â€  Thea asked in a low voice.

â€œWell, primarily, yes. But secondarily, why are we in Moonstone? It
isnâ€™t as if weâ€™d been born here. You were, but Wunsch wasnâ€™t, and I
wasnâ€™t. I suppose Iâ€™m here because I married as soon as I got out of
medical school and had to get a practice quick. If you hurry things,
you always get left in the end. I donâ€™t learn anything here, and as for
the peopleâ€”In my own town in Michigan, now, there were people who liked
me on my fatherâ€™s account, who had even known my grandfather. That
meant something. But here itâ€™s all like the sand: blows north one day
and south the next. Weâ€™re all a lot of gamblers without much nerve,
playing for small stakes. The railroad is the one real fact in this
country. That has to be; the world has to be got back and forth. But
the rest of us are here just because itâ€™s the end of a run and the
engine has to have a drink. Some day Iâ€™ll get up and find my hair
turning gray, and Iâ€™ll have nothing to show for it.â€ 

Thea slid closer to him and caught his arm. â€œNo, no. I wonâ€™t let you
get gray. Youâ€™ve got to stay young for me. Iâ€™m getting young now, too.â€ 

Archie laughed. â€œGetting?â€ 

â€œYes. People arenâ€™t young when theyâ€™re children. Look at Thor, now;
heâ€™s just a little old man. But Gus has a sweetheart, and heâ€™s young!â€ 

â€œSomething in that!â€  Dr. Archie patted her head, and then felt the
shape of her skull gently, with the tips of his fingers. â€œWhen you were
little, Thea, I used always to be curious about the shape of your head.
You seemed to have more inside it than most youngsters. I havenâ€™t
examined it for a long time. Seems to be the usual shape, but
uncommonly hard, some how. What are you going to do with yourself,
anyway?â€ 

â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ 

â€œHonest, now?â€  He lifted her chin and looked into her eyes.

Thea laughed and edged away from him.

â€œYouâ€™ve got something up your sleeve, havenâ€™t you? Anything you like;
only donâ€™t marry and settle down here without giving yourself a chance,
will you?â€ 

â€œNot much. See, thereâ€™s another rabbit!â€ 

â€œThatâ€™s all right about the rabbits, but I donâ€™t want you to get tied
up. Remember that.â€ 

Thea nodded. â€œBe nice to Wunsch, then. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™d do if he
went away.â€ 

â€œYouâ€™ve got older friends than Wunsch here, Thea.â€ 

â€œI know.â€  Thea spoke seriously and looked up at the moon, propping her
chin on her hand. â€œBut Wunsch is the only one that can teach me what I
want to know. Iâ€™ve got to learn to do something well, and thatâ€™s the
thing I can do best.â€ 

â€œDo you want to be a music-teacher?â€ 

â€œMaybe, but I want to be a good one. Iâ€™d like to go to Germany to
study, some day. Wunsch says thatâ€™s the best place,â€”the only place you
can really learn.â€  Thea hesitated and then went on nervously, â€œIâ€™ve got
a book that says so, too. Itâ€™s called â€˜My Musical Memories.â€™ It made me
want to go to Germany even before Wunsch said anything. Of course itâ€™s
a secret. Youâ€™re the first one Iâ€™ve told.â€ 

Dr. Archie smiled indulgently. â€œThatâ€™s a long way off. Is that what
youâ€™ve got in your hard noddle?â€  He put his hand on her hair, but this
time she shook him off.

â€œNo, I donâ€™t think much about it. But you talk about going, and a body
has to have something to go _to!_â€ 

â€œThatâ€™s so.â€  Dr. Archie sighed. â€œYouâ€™re lucky if you have. Poor Wunsch,
now, he hasnâ€™t. What do such fellows come out here for? Heâ€™s been
asking me about my mining stock, and about mining towns. What would he
do in a mining town? He wouldnâ€™t know a piece of ore if he saw one.
Heâ€™s got nothing to sell that a mining town wants to buy. Why donâ€™t
those old fellows stay at home? We wonâ€™t need them for another hundred
years. An engine wiper can get a job, but a piano player! Such people
canâ€™t make good.â€ 

â€œMy grandfather Alstrom was a musician, and he made good.â€ 

Dr. Archie chuckled. â€œOh, a Swede can make good anywhere, at anything!
Youâ€™ve got that in your favor, miss. Come, you must be getting home.â€ 

Thea rose. â€œYes, I used to be ashamed of being a Swede, but Iâ€™m not any
more. Swedes are kind of common, but I think itâ€™s better to be
_something_.â€ 

â€œIt surely is! How tall you are getting. You come above my shoulder
now.â€ 

â€œIâ€™ll keep on growing, donâ€™t you think? I particularly want to be tall.
Yes, I guess I must go home. I wish thereâ€™d be a fire.â€ 

â€œA fire?â€ 

â€œYes, so the fire-bell would ring and the roundhouse whistle would
blow, and everybody would come running out. Sometime Iâ€™m going to ring
the fire-bell myself and stir them all up.â€ 

â€œYouâ€™d be arrested.â€ 

â€œWell, that would be better than going to bed.â€ 

â€œIâ€™ll have to lend you some more books.â€ 

Thea shook herself impatiently. â€œI canâ€™t read every night.â€ 

Dr. Archie gave one of his low, sympathetic chuckles as he opened the
gate for her. â€œYouâ€™re beginning to grow up, thatâ€™s whatâ€™s the matter
with you. Iâ€™ll have to keep an eye on you. Now youâ€™ll have to say
good-night to the moon.â€ 

â€œNo, I wonâ€™t. I sleep on the floor now, right in the moonlight. My
window comes down to the floor, and I can look at the sky all night.â€ 

She shot round the house to the kitchen door, and Dr. Archie watched
her disappear with a sigh. He thought of the hard, mean, frizzy little
woman who kept his house for him; once the belle of a Michigan town,
now dry and withered up at thirty. â€œIf I had a daughter like Thea to
watch,â€  he reflected, â€œI wouldnâ€™t mind anything. I wonder if all of my
lifeâ€™s going to be a mistake just because I made a big one then? Hardly
seems fair.â€ 

Howard Archie was â€œrespectedâ€  rather than popular in Moonstone.
Everyone recognized that he was a good physician, and a progressive
Western town likes to be able to point to a handsome, well-set-up,
well-dressed man among its citizens. But a great many people thought
Archie â€œdistant,â€  and they were right. He had the uneasy manner of a
man who is not among his own kind, and who has not seen enough of the
world to feel that all people are in some sense his own kind. He knew
that every one was curious about his wife, that she played a sort of
character part in Moonstone, and that people made fun of her, not very
delicately. Her own friendsâ€”most of them women who were distasteful to
Archieâ€”liked to ask her to contribute to church charities, just to see
how mean she could be. The little, lop-sided cake at the church supper,
the cheapest pincushion, the skimpiest apron at the bazaar, were always
Mrs. Archieâ€™s contribution.

All this hurt the doctorâ€™s pride. But if there was one thing he had
learned, it was that there was no changing Belleâ€™s nature. He had
married a mean woman; and he must accept the consequences. Even in
Colorado he would have had no pretext for divorce, and, to do him
justice, he had never thought of such a thing. The tenets of the
Presbyterian Church in which he had grown up, though he had long ceased
to believe in them, still influenced his conduct and his conception of
propriety. To him there was something vulgar about divorce. A divorced
man was a disgraced man; at least, he had exhibited his hurt, and made
it a matter for common gossip. Respectability was so necessary to
Archie that he was willing to pay a high price for it. As long as he
could keep up a decent exterior, he could manage to get on; and if he
could have concealed his wifeâ€™s littleness from all his friends, he
would scarcely have complained. He was more afraid of pity than he was
of any unhappiness. Had there been another woman for whom he cared
greatly, he might have had plenty of courage; but he was not likely to
meet such a woman in Moonstone.

There was a puzzling timidity in Archieâ€™s make-up. The thing that held
his shoulders stiff, that made him resort to a mirthless little laugh
when he was talking to dull people, that made him sometimes stumble
over rugs and carpets, had its counterpart in his mind. He had not the
courage to be an honest thinker. He could comfort himself by evasions
and compromises. He consoled himself for his own marriage by telling
himself that other peopleâ€™s were not much better. In his work he saw
pretty deeply into marital relations in Moonstone, and he could
honestly say that there were not many of his friends whom he envied.
Their wives seemed to suit them well enough, but they would never have
suited him.

Although Dr. Archie could not bring himself to regard marriage merely
as a social contract, but looked upon it as somehow made sacred by a
church in which he did not believe,â€”as a physician he knew that a young
man whose marriage is merely nominal must yet go on living his life.
When he went to Denver or to Chicago, he drifted about in careless
company where gayety and good-humor can be bought, not because he had
any taste for such society, but because he honestly believed that
anything was better than divorce. He often told himself that â€œhanging
and wiving go by destiny.â€  If wiving went badly with a man,â€”and it did
oftener than not,â€”then he must do the best he could to keep up
appearances and help the tradition of domestic happiness along. The
Moonstone gossips, assembled in Mrs. Smileyâ€™s millinery and notion
store, often discussed Dr. Archieâ€™s politeness to his wife, and his
pleasant manner of speaking about her. â€œNobody has ever got a thing out
of him yet,â€  they agreed. And it was certainly not because no one had
ever tried.

When he was down in Denver, feeling a little jolly, Archie could forget
how unhappy he was at home, and could even make himself believe that he
missed his wife. He always bought her presents, and would have liked to
send her flowers if she had not repeatedly told him never to send her
anything but bulbs,â€”which did not appeal to him in his expansive
moments. At the Denver Athletic Club banquets, or at dinner with his
colleagues at the Brown Palace Hotel, he sometimes spoke sentimentally
about â€œlittle Mrs. Archie,â€  and he always drank the toast â€œto our
wives, God bless them!â€  with gusto.

The determining factor about Dr. Archie was that he was romantic. He
had married Belle White because he was romanticâ€”too romantic to know
anything about women, except what he wished them to be, or to repulse a
pretty girl who had set her cap for him. At medical school, though he
was a rather wild boy in behavior, he had always disliked coarse jokes
and vulgar stories. In his old Flintâ€™s Physiology there was still a
poem he had pasted there when he was a student; some verses by Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes about the ideals of the medical profession. After
so much and such disillusioning experience with it, he still had a
romantic feeling about the human body; a sense that finer things dwelt
in it than could be explained by anatomy. He never jested about birth
or death or marriage, and did not like to hear other doctors do it. He
was a good nurse, and had a reverence for the bodies of women and
children. When he was tending them, one saw him at his best. Then his
constraint and self-consciousness fell away from him. He was easy,
gentle, competent, master of himself and of other people. Then the
idealist in him was not afraid of being discovered and ridiculed.

In his tastes, too, the doctor was romantic. Though he read Balzac all
the year through, he still enjoyed the Waverley Novels as much as when
he had first come upon them, in thick leather-bound volumes, in his
grandfatherâ€™s library. He nearly always read Scott on Christmas and
holidays, because it brought back the pleasures of his boyhood so
vividly. He liked Scottâ€™s women. Constance de Beverley and the minstrel
girl in â€œThe Fair Maid of Perth,â€  not the Duchesse de Langeais, were
his heroines. But better than anything that ever got from the heart of
a man into printerâ€™s ink, he loved the poetry of Robert Burns. â€œDeath
and Dr. Hornbookâ€  and â€œThe Jolly Beggars,â€  Burnsâ€™s â€œReply to his
Tailor,â€  he often read aloud to himself in his office, late at night,
after a glass of hot toddy. He used to read â€œTam oâ€™Shanterâ€  to Thea
Kronborg, and he got her some of the songs, set to the old airs for
which they were written. He loved to hear her sing them. Sometimes when
she sang, â€œOh, wert thou in the cauld blast,â€  the doctor and even Mr.
Kronborg joined in. Thea never minded if people could not sing; she
directed them with her head and somehow carried them along. When her
father got off the pitch she let her own voice out and covered him.




XIII


At the beginning of June, when school closed, Thea had told Wunsch that
she didnâ€™t know how much practicing she could get in this summer
because Thor had his worst teeth still to cut.

â€œMy God! all last summer he was doing that!â€  Wunsch exclaimed
furiously.

â€œI know, but it takes them two years, and Thor is slow,â€  Thea answered
reprovingly.

The summer went well beyond her hopes, however. She told herself that
it was the best summer of her life, so far. Nobody was sick at home,
and her lessons were uninterrupted. Now that she had four pupils of her
own and made a dollar a week, her practicing was regarded more
seriously by the household. Her mother had always arranged things so
that she could have the parlor four hours a day in summer. Thor proved
a friendly ally. He behaved handsomely about his molars, and never
objected to being pulled off into remote places in his cart. When Thea
dragged him over the hill and made a camp under the shade of a bush or
a bank, he would waddle about and play with his blocks, or bury his
monkey in the sand and dig him up again. Sometimes he got into the
cactus and set up a howl, but usually he let his sister read
peacefully, while he coated his hands and face, first with an all-day
sucker and then with gravel.

Life was pleasant and uneventful until the first of September, when
Wunsch began to drink so hard that he was unable to appear when Thea
went to take her mid-week lesson, and Mrs. Kohler had to send her home
after a tearful apology. On Saturday morning she set out for the
Kohlersâ€™ again, but on her way, when she was crossing the ravine, she
noticed a woman sitting at the bottom of the gulch, under the railroad
trestle. She turned from her path and saw that it was Mrs. Tellamantez,
and she seemed to be doing drawn-work. Then Thea noticed that there was
something beside her, covered up with a purple and yellow Mexican
blanket. She ran up the gulch and called to Mrs. Tellamantez. The
Mexican woman held up a warning finger. Thea glanced at the blanket and
recognized a square red hand which protruded. The middle finger
twitched slightly.

â€œIs he hurt?â€  she gasped.

Mrs. Tellamantez shook her head. â€œNo; very sick. He knows nothing,â€  she
said quietly, folding her hands over her drawn-work.

Thea learned that Wunsch had been out all night, that this morning Mrs.
Kohler had gone to look for him and found him under the trestle covered
with dirt and cinders. Probably he had been trying to get home and had
lost his way. Mrs. Tellamantez was watching beside the unconscious man
while Mrs. Kohler and Johnny went to get help.

â€œYou better go home now, I think,â€  said Mrs. Tellamantez, in closing
her narration.

Thea hung her head and looked wistfully toward the blanket.

â€œCouldnâ€™t I just stay till they come?â€  she asked. â€œIâ€™d like to know if
heâ€™s very bad.â€ 

â€œBad enough,â€  sighed Mrs. Tellamantez, taking up her work again.

Thea sat down under the narrow shade of one of the trestle posts and
listened to the locusts rasping in the hot sand while she watched Mrs.
Tellamantez evenly draw her threads. The blanket looked as if it were
over a heap of bricks.

â€œI donâ€™t see him breathing any,â€  she said anxiously.

â€œYes, he breathes,â€  said Mrs. Tellamantez, not lifting her eyes.

It seemed to Thea that they waited for hours. At last they heard
voices, and a party of men came down the hill and up the gulch. Dr.
Archie and Fritz Kohler came first; behind were Johnny and Ray, and
several men from the roundhouse. Ray had the canvas litter that was
kept at the depot for accidents on the road. Behind them trailed half a
dozen boys who had been hanging round the depot.

When Ray saw Thea, he dropped his canvas roll and hurried forward.
â€œBetter run along home, Thee. This is ugly business.â€  Ray was indignant
that anybody who gave Thea music lessons should behave in such a
manner.

Thea resented both his proprietary tone and his superior virtue. â€œI
wonâ€™t. I want to know how bad he is. Iâ€™m not a baby!â€  she exclaimed
indignantly, stamping her foot into the sand.

Dr. Archie, who had been kneeling by the blanket, got up and came
toward Thea, dusting his knees. He smiled and nodded confidentially.
â€œHeâ€™ll be all right when we get him home. But he wouldnâ€™t want you to
see him like this, poor old chap! Understand? Now, skip!â€ 

Thea ran down the gulch and looked back only once, to see them lifting
the canvas litter with Wunsch upon it, still covered with the blanket.

The men carried Wunsch up the hill and down the road to the Kohlersâ€™.
Mrs. Kohler had gone home and made up a bed in the sitting-room, as she
knew the litter could not be got round the turn in the narrow stairway.
Wunsch was like a dead man. He lay unconscious all day. Ray Kennedy
stayed with him till two oâ€™clock in the afternoon, when he had to go
out on his run. It was the first time he had ever been inside the
Kohlersâ€™ house, and he was so much impressed by Napoleon that the
piece-picture formed a new bond between him and Thea.

Dr. Archie went back at six oâ€™clock, and found Mrs. Kohler and Spanish
Johnny with Wunsch, who was in a high fever, muttering and groaning.

â€œThere ought to be some one here to look after him to-night, Mrs.
Kohler,â€  he said. â€œIâ€™m on a confinement case, and I canâ€™t be here, but
there ought to be somebody. He may get violent.â€ 

Mrs. Kohler insisted that she could always do anything with Wunsch, but
the doctor shook his head and Spanish Johnny grinned. He said he would
stay. The doctor laughed at him. â€œTen fellows like you couldnâ€™t hold
him, Spanish, if he got obstreperous; an Irishman would have his hands
full. Guess Iâ€™d better put the soft pedal on him.â€  He pulled out his
hypodermic.

Spanish Johnny stayed, however, and the Kohlers went to bed. At about
two oâ€™clock in the morning Wunsch rose from his ignominious cot.
Johnny, who was dozing on the lounge, awoke to find the German standing
in the middle of the room in his undershirt and drawers, his arms bare,
his heavy body seeming twice its natural girth. His face was snarling
and savage, and his eyes were crazy. He had risen to avenge himself, to
wipe out his shame, to destroy his enemy. One look was enough for
Johnny. Wunsch raised a chair threateningly, and Johnny, with the
lightness of a _picador_, darted under the missile and out of the open
window. He shot across the gully to get help, meanwhile leaving the
Kohlers to their fate.

Fritz, upstairs, heard the chair crash upon the stove. Then he heard
doors opening and shutting, and some one stumbling about in the
shrubbery of the garden. He and Paulina sat up in bed and held a
consultation. Fritz slipped from under the covers, and going cautiously
over to the window, poked out his head. Then he rushed to the door and
bolted it.

â€œ_Mein Gott_, Paulina,â€  he gasped, â€œhe has the axe, he will kill us!â€ 

â€œThe dresser,â€  cried Mrs. Kohler; â€œpush the dresser before the door.
_Ach_, if you had your rabbit gun, now!â€ 

â€œIt is in the barn,â€  said Fritz sadly. â€œIt would do no good; he would
not be afraid of anything now. Stay you in the bed, Paulina.â€  The
dresser had lost its casters years ago, but he managed to drag it in
front of the door. â€œHe is in the garden. He makes nothing. He will get
sick again, may-be.â€ 

Fritz went back to bed and his wife pulled the quilt over him and made
him lie down. They heard stumbling in the garden again, then a smash of
glass.

â€œ_Ach, das Mistbeet!_â€  gasped Paulina, hearing her hotbed shivered.
â€œThe poor soul, Fritz, he will cut himself. _Ach!_ what is that?â€  They
both sat up in bed. â€œ_Wieder! Ach_, What is he doing?â€ 

The noise came steadily, a sound of chopping. Paulina tore off her
night-cap. â€œ_Die BÃ¤ume, die BÃ¤ume!_ He is cutting our trees, Fritz!â€ 
Before her husband could prevent her, she had sprung from the bed and
rushed to the window. â€œ_Der Taubenschlag! Gerechter Himmel_, he is
chopping the dove-house down!â€ 

Fritz reached her side before she had got her breath again, and poked
his head out beside hers. There, in the faint starlight, they saw a
bulky man, barefoot, half dressed, chopping away at the white post that
formed the pedestal of the dove-house. The startled pigeons were
croaking and flying about his head, even beating their wings in his
face, so that he struck at them furiously with the axe. In a few
seconds there was a crash, and Wunsch had actually felled the
dove-house.

â€œOh, if only it is not the trees next!â€  prayed Paulina. â€œThe dove-house
you can make new again, but not _die BÃ¤ume_.â€ 

They watched breathlessly. In the garden below Wunsch stood in the
attitude of a woodman, contemplating the fallen cote. Suddenly he threw
the axe over his shoulder and went out of the front gate toward the
town.

â€œThe poor soul, he will meet his death!â€  Mrs. Kohler wailed. She ran
back to her feather bed and hid her face in the pillow.

Fritz kept watch at the window. â€œNo, no, Paulina,â€  he called presently;
â€œI see lanterns coming. Johnny must have gone for somebody. Yes, four
lanterns, coming along the gulch. They stop; they must have seen him
already. Now they are under the hill and I cannot see them, but I think
they have him. They will bring him back. I must dress and go down.â€  He
caught his trousers and began pulling them on by the window. â€œYes, here
they come, half a dozen men. And they have tied him with a rope,
Paulina!â€ 

â€œ_Ach_, the poor man! To be led like a cow,â€  groaned Mrs. Kohler. â€œOh,
it is good that he has no wife!â€  She was reproaching herself for
nagging Fritz when he drank himself into foolish pleasantry or mild
sulks, and felt that she had never before appreciated her blessings.

Wunsch was in bed for ten days, during which time he was gossiped about
and even preached about in Moonstone. The Baptist preacher took a shot
at the fallen man from his pulpit, Mrs. Livery Johnson nodding
approvingly from her pew. The mothers of Wunschâ€™s pupils sent him notes
informing him that their daughters would discontinue their
music-lessons. The old maid who had rented him her piano sent the town
dray for her contaminated instrument, and ever afterward declared that
Wunsch had ruined its tone and scarred its glossy finish. The Kohlers
were unremitting in their kindness to their friend. Mrs. Kohler made
him soups and broths without stint, and Fritz repaired the dove-house
and mounted it on a new post, lest it might be a sad reminder.

As soon as Wunsch was strong enough to sit about in his slippers and
wadded jacket, he told Fritz to bring him some stout thread from the
shop. When Fritz asked what he was going to sew, he produced the
tattered score of â€œOrpheusâ€  and said he would like to fix it up for a
little present. Fritz carried it over to the shop and stitched it into
pasteboards, covered with dark suiting-cloth. Over the stitches he
glued a strip of thin red leather which he got from his friend, the
harness-maker. After Paulina had cleaned the pages with fresh bread,
Wunsch was amazed to see what a fine book he had. It opened stiffly,
but that was no matter.

Sitting in the arbor one morning, under the ripe grapes and the brown,
curling leaves, with a pen and ink on the bench beside him and the
Gluck score on his knee, Wunsch pondered for a long while. Several
times he dipped the pen in the ink, and then put it back again in the
cigar box in which Mrs. Kohler kept her writing utensils. His thoughts
wandered over a wide territory; over many countries and many years.
There was no order or logical sequence in his ideas. Pictures came and
went without reason. Faces, mountains, rivers, autumn days in other
vineyards far away. He thought of a _Fuszreise_ he had made through the
Hartz Mountains in his student days; of the innkeeperâ€™s pretty daughter
who had lighted his pipe for him in the garden one summer evening, of
the woods above Wiesbaden, haymakers on an island in the river. The
roundhouse whistle woke him from his reveries. Ah, yes, he was in
Moonstone, Colorado. He frowned for a moment and looked at the book on
his knee. He had thought of a great many appropriate things to write in
it, but suddenly he rejected all of them, opened the book, and at the
top of the much-engraved title-page he wrote rapidly in purple ink:â€”

Einst, O Wunder!â€”


A. Wunsch.


Moonstone, Colo.
September 30, 18â€”


Nobody in Moonstone ever found what Wunschâ€™s first name was. That â€œAâ€ 
may have stood for Adam, or August, or even Amadeus; he got very angry
if any one asked him.

He remained A. Wunsch to the end of his chapter there. When he
presented this score to Thea, he told her that in ten years she would
either know what the inscription meant, or she would not have the least
idea, in which case it would not matter.

When Wunsch began to pack his trunk, both the Kohlers were very
unhappy. He said he was coming back some day, but that for the present,
since he had lost all his pupils, it would be better for him to try
some â€œnew town.â€  Mrs. Kohler darned and mended all his clothes, and
gave him two new shirts she had made for Fritz. Fritz made him a new
pair of trousers and would have made him an overcoat but for the fact
that overcoats were so easy to pawn.

Wunsch would not go across the ravine to the town until he went to take
the morning train for Denver. He said that after he got to Denver he
would â€œlook around.â€  He left Moonstone one bright October morning,
without telling any one good-bye. He bought his ticket and went
directly into the smoking-car. When the train was beginning to pull
out, he heard his name called frantically, and looking out of the
window he saw Thea Kronborg standing on the siding, bareheaded and
panting. Some boys had brought word to school that they saw Wunschâ€™s
trunk going over to the station, and Thea had run away from school. She
was at the end of the station platform, her hair in two braids, her
blue gingham dress wet to the knees because she had run across lots
through the weeds. It had rained during the night, and the tall
sunflowers behind her were fresh and shining.

â€œGood-bye, Herr Wunsch, good-bye!â€  she called waving to him.

He thrust his head out at the car window and called back, â€œ_Leben sie
wohl, leben sie wohl, mein Kind!_â€  He watched her until the train swept
around the curve beyond the roundhouse, and then sank back into his
seat, muttering, â€œShe had been running. Ah, she will run a long way;
they cannot stop her!â€ 

What was it about the child that one believed in? Was it her dogged
industry, so unusual in this free-and-easy country? Was it her
imagination? More likely it was because she had both imagination and a
stubborn will, curiously balancing and interpenetrating each other.
There was something unconscious and unawakened about her, that tempted
curiosity. She had a kind of seriousness that he had not met with in a
pupil before. She hated difficult things, and yet she could never pass
one by. They seemed to challenge her; she had no peace until she
mastered them. She had the power to make a great effort, to lift a
weight heavier than herself. Wunsch hoped he would always remember her
as she stood by the track, looking up at him; her broad eager face, so
fair in color, with its high cheek-bones, yellow eyebrows and
greenishhazel eyes. It was a face full of light and energy, of the
unquestioning hopefulness of first youth. Yes, she was like a flower
full of sun, but not the soft German flowers of his childhood. He had
it now, the comparison he had absently reached for before: she was like
the yellow prickly pear blossoms that open there in the desert;
thornier and sturdier than the maiden flowers he remembered; not so
sweet, but wonderful.

That night Mrs. Kohler brushed away many a tear as she got supper and
set the table for two. When they sat down, Fritz was more silent than
usual. People who have lived long together need a third at table: they
know each otherâ€™s thoughts so well that they have nothing left to say.
Mrs. Kohler stirred and stirred her coffee and clattered the spoon, but
she had no heart for her supper. She felt, for the first time in years,
that she was tired of her own cooking. She looked across the glass lamp
at her husband and asked him if the butcher liked his new overcoat, and
whether he had got the shoulders right in a ready-made suit he was
patching over for Ray Kennedy. After supper Fritz offered to wipe the
dishes for her, but she told him to go about his business, and not to
act as if she were sick or getting helpless.

When her work in the kitchen was all done, she went out to cover the
oleanders against frost, and to take a last look at her chickens. As
she came back from the hen-house she stopped by one of the linden trees
and stood resting her hand on the trunk. He would never come back, the
poor man; she knew that. He would drift on from new town to new town,
from catastrophe to catastrophe. He would hardly find a good home for
himself again. He would die at last in some rough place, and be buried
in the desert or on the wild prairie, far enough from any linden tree!

Fritz, smoking his pipe on the kitchen doorstep, watched his Paulina
and guessed her thoughts. He, too, was sorry to lose his friend. But
Fritz was getting old; he had lived a long while and had learned to
lose without struggle.




XIV


â€œMother,â€  said Peter Kronborg to his wife one morning about two weeks
after Wunschâ€™s departure, â€œhow would you like to drive out to Copper
Hole with me to-day?â€ 

Mrs. Kronborg said she thought she would enjoy the drive. She put on
her gray cashmere dress and gold watch and chain, as befitted a
ministerâ€™s wife, and while her husband was dressing she packed a black
oilcloth satchel with such clothing as she and Thor would need
overnight.

Copper Hole was a settlement fifteen miles northwest of Moonstone where
Mr. Kronborg preached every Friday evening. There was a big spring
there and a creek and a few irrigating ditches. It was a community of
discouraged agriculturists who had disastrously experimented with dry
farming. Mr. Kronborg always drove out one day and back the next,
spending the night with one of his parishioners. Often, when the
weather was fine, his wife accompanied him. To-day they set out from
home after the midday meal, leaving Tillie in charge of the house. Mrs.
Kronborgâ€™s maternal feeling was always garnered up in the baby, whoever
the baby happened to be. If she had the baby with her, the others could
look out for themselves. Thor, of course, was not, accurately speaking,
a baby any longer. In the matter of nourishment he was quite
independent of his mother, though this independence had not been won
without a struggle. Thor was conservative in all things, and the whole
family had anguished with him when he was being weaned. Being the
youngest, he was still the baby for Mrs. Kronborg, though he was nearly
four years old and sat up boldly on her lap this afternoon, holding on
to the ends of the lines and shouting â€œâ€™mup, â€™mup, horsey.â€  His father
watched him affectionately and hummed hymn tunes in the jovial way that
was sometimes such a trial to Thea.

Mrs. Kronborg was enjoying the sunshine and the brilliant sky and all
the faintly marked features of the dazzling, monotonous landscape. She
had a rather unusual capacity for getting the flavor of places and of
people. Although she was so enmeshed in family cares most of the time,
she could emerge serene when she was away from them. For a mother of
seven, she had a singularly unprejudiced point of view. She was,
moreover, a fatalist, and as she did not attempt to direct things
beyond her control, she found a good deal of time to enjoy the ways of
man and nature.

When they were well upon their road, out where the first lean pasture
lands began and the sand grass made a faint showing between the
sagebrushes, Mr. Kronborg dropped his tune and turned to his wife.
â€œMother, Iâ€™ve been thinking about something.â€ 

â€œI guessed you had. What is it?â€  She shifted Thor to her left knee,
where he would be more out of the way.

â€œWell, itâ€™s about Thea. Mr. Follansbee came to my study at the church
the other day and said they would like to have their two girls take
lessons of Thea. Then I sounded Miss Meyersâ€  (Miss Meyers was the
organist in Mr. Kronborgâ€™s church) â€œand she said there was a good deal
of talk about whether Thea wouldnâ€™t take over Wunschâ€™s pupils. She said
if Thea stopped school she wouldnâ€™t wonder if she could get pretty much
all Wunschâ€™s class. People think Thea knows about all Wunsch could
teach.â€ 

Mrs. Kronborg looked thoughtful. â€œDo you think we ought to take her out
of school so young?â€ 

â€œShe is young, but next year would be her last year anyway. Sheâ€™s far
along for her age. And she canâ€™t learn much under the principal weâ€™ve
got now, can she?â€ 

â€œNo, Iâ€™m afraid she canâ€™t,â€  his wife admitted. â€œShe frets a good deal
and says that man always has to look in the back of the book for the
answers. She hates all that diagramming they have to do, and I think
myself itâ€™s a waste of time.â€ 

Mr. Kronborg settled himself back into the seat and slowed the mare to
a walk. â€œYou see, it occurs to me that we might raise Theaâ€™s prices, so
it would be worth her while. Seventy-five cents for hour lessons, fifty
cents for half-hour lessons. If she got, say two thirds of Wunschâ€™s
class, that would bring her in upwards of ten dollars a week. Better
pay than teaching a country school, and there would be more work in
vacation than in winter. Steady work twelve months in the year; thatâ€™s
an advantage. And sheâ€™d be living at home, with no expenses.â€ 

â€œThereâ€™d be talk if you raised her prices,â€  said Mrs. Kronborg
dubiously.

â€œAt first there would. But Thea is so much the best musician in town
that theyâ€™d all come into line after a while. A good many people in
Moonstone have been making money lately, and have bought new pianos.
There were ten new pianos shipped in here from Denver in the last year.
People ainâ€™t going to let them stand idle; too much money invested. I
believe Thea can have as many scholars as she can handle, if we set her
up a little.â€ 

â€œHow set her up, do you mean?â€  Mrs. Kronborg felt a certain reluctance
about accepting this plan, though she had not yet had time to think out
her reasons.

â€œWell, Iâ€™ve been thinking for some time we could make good use of
another room. We couldnâ€™t give up the parlor to her all the time. If we
built another room on the ell and put the piano in there, she could
give lessons all day long and it wouldnâ€™t bother us. We could build a
clothes-press in it, and put in a bed-lounge and a dresser and let Anna
have it for her sleeping-room. She needs a place of her own, now that
sheâ€™s beginning to be dressy.â€ 

â€œSeems like Thea ought to have the choice of the room, herself,â€  said
Mrs. Kronborg.

â€œBut, my dear, she donâ€™t want it. Wonâ€™t have it. I sounded her coming
home from church on Sunday; asked her if she would like to sleep in a
new room, if we built on. She fired up like a little wild-cat and said
sheâ€™d made her own room all herself, and she didnâ€™t think anybody ought
to take it away from her.â€ 

â€œShe donâ€™t mean to be impertinent, father. Sheâ€™s made decided that way,
like my father.â€  Mrs. Kronborg spoke warmly. â€œI never have any trouble
with the child. I remember my fatherâ€™s ways and go at her carefully.
Theaâ€™s all right.â€ 

Mr. Kronborg laughed indulgently and pinched Thorâ€™s full cheek. â€œOh, I
didnâ€™t mean anything against your girl, mother! Sheâ€™s all right, but
sheâ€™s a little wild-cat, just the same. I think Ray Kennedyâ€™s planning
to spoil a born old maid.â€ 

â€œHuh! Sheâ€™ll get something a good sight better than Ray Kennedy, you
see! Theaâ€™s an awful smart girl. Iâ€™ve seen a good many girls take music
lessons in my time, but I ainâ€™t seen one that took to it so. Wunsch
said so, too. Sheâ€™s got the making of something in her.â€ 

â€œI donâ€™t deny that, and the sooner she gets at it in a businesslike
way, the better. Sheâ€™s the kind that takes responsibility, and itâ€™ll be
good for her.â€ 

Mrs. Kronborg was thoughtful. â€œIn some ways it will, maybe. But thereâ€™s
a good deal of strain about teaching youngsters, and sheâ€™s always
worked so hard with the scholars she has. Iâ€™ve often listened to her
pounding it into â€™em. I donâ€™t want to work her too hard. Sheâ€™s so
serious that sheâ€™s never had what you might call any real childhood.
Seems like she ought to have the next few years sort of free and easy.
Sheâ€™ll be tied down with responsibilities soon enough.â€ 

Mr. Kronborg patted his wifeâ€™s arm. â€œDonâ€™t you believe it, mother. Thea
is not the marrying kind. Iâ€™ve watched â€™em. Anna will marry before long
and make a good wife, but I donâ€™t see Thea bringing up a family. Sheâ€™s
got a good deal of her mother in her, but she hasnâ€™t got all. Sheâ€™s too
peppery and too fond of having her own way. Then sheâ€™s always got to be
ahead in everything. That kind make good church-workers and
missionaries and school teachers, but they donâ€™t make good wives. They
fret all their energy away, like colts, and get cut on the wire.â€ 

Mrs. Kronborg laughed. â€œGive me the graham crackers I put in your
pocket for Thor. Heâ€™s hungry. Youâ€™re a funny man, Peter. A body
wouldnâ€™t think, to hear you, you was talking about your own daughters.
I guess you see through â€™em. Still, even if Thea ainâ€™t apt to have
children of her own, I donâ€™t know as thatâ€™s a good reason why she
should wear herself out on other peopleâ€™s.â€ 

â€œThatâ€™s just the point, mother. A girl with all that energy has got to
do something, same as a boy, to keep her out of mischief. If you donâ€™t
want her to marry Ray, let her do something to make herself
independent.â€ 

â€œWell, Iâ€™m not against it. It might be the best thing for her. I wish I
felt sure she wouldnâ€™t worry. She takes things hard. She nearly cried
herself sick about Wunschâ€™s going away. Sheâ€™s the smartest child of â€™em
all, Peter, by a long ways.â€ 

Peter Kronborg smiled. â€œThere you go, Anna. Thatâ€™s you all over again.
Now, I have no favorites; they all have their good points. But you,â€ 
with a twinkle, â€œalways did go in for brains.â€ 

Mrs. Kronborg chuckled as she wiped the cracker crumbs from Thorâ€™s chin
and fists. â€œWell, youâ€™re mighty conceited, Peter! But I donâ€™t know as I
ever regretted it. I prefer having a family of my own to fussing with
other folksâ€™ children, thatâ€™s the truth.â€ 

Before the Kronborgs reached Copper Hole, Theaâ€™s destiny was pretty
well mapped out for her. Mr. Kronborg was always delighted to have an
excuse for enlarging the house.

Mrs. Kronborg was quite right in her conjecture that there would be
unfriendly comment in Moonstone when Thea raised her prices for
music-lessons. People said she was getting too conceited for anything.
Mrs. Livery Johnson put on a new bonnet and paid up all her back calls
to have the pleasure of announcing in each parlor she entered that her
daughters, at least, would â€œnever pay professional prices to Thea
Kronborg.â€ 

Thea raised no objection to quitting school. She was now in the â€œhigh
room,â€  as it was called, in next to the highest class, and was studying
geometry and beginning Caesar. She no longer recited her lessons to the
teacher she liked, but to the Principal, a man who belonged, like Mrs.
Livery Johnson, to the camp of Theaâ€™s natural enemies. He taught school
because he was too lazy to work among grown-up people, and he made an
easy job of it. He got out of real work by inventing useless activities
for his pupils, such as the â€œtree-diagramming system.â€  Thea had spent
hours making trees out of â€œThanatopsis,â€  Hamletâ€™s soliloquy, Cato on
â€œImmortality.â€  She agonized under this waste of time, and was only too
glad to accept her fatherâ€™s offer of liberty.

So Thea left school the first of November. By the first of January she
had eight one-hour pupils and ten half-hour pupils, and there would be
more in the summer. She spent her earnings generously. She bought a new
Brussels carpet for the parlor, and a rifle for Gunner and Axel, and an
imitation tiger-skin coat and cap for Thor. She enjoyed being able to
add to the family possessions, and thought Thor looked quite as
handsome in his spots as the rich children she had seen in Denver. Thor
was most complacent in his conspicuous apparel. He could walk anywhere
by this timeâ€”though he always preferred to sit, or to be pulled in his
cart. He was a blissfully lazy child, and had a number of long, dull
plays, such as making nests for his china duck and waiting for her to
lay him an egg. Thea thought him very intelligent, and she was proud
that he was so big and burly. She found him restful, loved to hear him
call her â€œsitter,â€  and really liked his companionship, especially when
she was tired. On Saturday, for instance, when she taught from nine in
the morning until five in the afternoon, she liked to get off in a
corner with Thor after supper, away from all the bathing and dressing
and joking and talking that went on in the house, and ask him about his
duck, or hear him tell one of his rambling stories.

By the time Theaâ€™s fifteenth birthday came round, she was established
as a music teacher in Moonstone. The new room had been added to the
house early in the spring, and Thea had been giving her lessons there
since the middle of May. She liked the personal independence which was
accorded her as a wage-earner. The family questioned her comings and
goings very little. She could go buggy-riding with Ray Kennedy, for
instance, without taking Gunner or Axel. She could go to Spanish
Johnnyâ€™s and sing part songs with the Mexicans, and nobody objected.

Thea was still under the first excitement of teaching, and was terribly
in earnest about it. If a pupil did not get on well, she fumed and
fretted. She counted until she was hoarse. She listened to scales in
her sleep. Wunsch had taught only one pupil seriously, but Thea taught
twenty. The duller they were, the more furiously she poked and prodded
them. With the little girls she was nearly always patient, but with
pupils older than herself, she sometimes lost her temper. One of her
mistakes was to let herself in for a calling-down from Mrs. Livery
Johnson. That lady appeared at the Kronborgsâ€™ one morning and announced
that she would allow no girl to stamp her foot at her daughter Grace.
She added that Theaâ€™s bad manners with the older girls were being
talked about all over town, and that if her temper did not speedily
improve she would lose all her advanced pupils. Thea was frightened.
She felt she could never bear the disgrace, if such a thing happened.
Besides, what would her father say, after he had gone to the expense of
building an addition to the house? Mrs. Johnson demanded an apology to
Grace. Thea said she was willing to make it. Mrs. Johnson said that
hereafter, since she had taken lessons of the best piano teacher in
Grinnell, Iowa, she herself would decide what pieces Grace should
study. Thea readily consented to that, and Mrs. Johnson rustled away to
tell a neighbor woman that Thea Kronborg could be meek enough when you
went at her right.

Thea was telling Ray about this unpleasant encounter as they were
driving out to the sand hills the next Sunday.

â€œShe was stuffing you, all right, Thee,â€  Ray reassured her. â€œThereâ€™s no
general dissatisfaction among your scholars. She just wanted to get in
a knock. I talked to the piano tuner the last time he was here, and he
said all the people he tuned for expressed themselves very favorably
about your teaching. I wish you didnâ€™t take so much pains with them,
myself.â€ 

â€œBut I have to, Ray. Theyâ€™re all so dumb. Theyâ€™ve got no ambition,â€ 
Thea exclaimed irritably. â€œJenny Smiley is the only one who isnâ€™t
stupid. She can read pretty well, and she has such good hands. But she
donâ€™t care a rap about it. She has no pride.â€ 

Rayâ€™s face was full of complacent satisfaction as he glanced sidewise
at Thea, but she was looking off intently into the mirage, at one of
those mammoth cattle that are nearly always reflected there. â€œDo you
find it easier to teach in your new room?â€  he asked.

â€œYes; Iâ€™m not interrupted so much. Of course, if I ever happen to want
to practice at night, thatâ€™s always the night Anna chooses to go to bed
early.â€ 

â€œItâ€™s a darned shame, Thee, you didnâ€™t cop that room for yourself. Iâ€™m
sore at the _padre_ about that. He ought to give you that room. You
could fix it up so pretty.â€ 

â€œI didnâ€™t want it, honest I didnâ€™t. Father would have let me have it. I
like my own room better. Somehow I can think better in a little room.
Besides, up there I am away from everybody, and I can read as late as I
please and nobody nags me.â€ 

â€œA growing girl needs lots of sleep,â€  Ray providently remarked.

Thea moved restlessly on the buggy cushions. â€œThey need other things
more,â€  she muttered. â€œOh, I forgot. I brought something to show you.
Look here, it came on my birthday. Wasnâ€™t it nice of him to remember?â€ 
She took from her pocket a postcard, bent in the middle and folded, and
handed it to Ray. On it was a white dove, perched on a wreath of very
blue forget-me-nots, and â€œBirthday Greetingsâ€  in gold letters. Under
this was written, â€œFrom A. Wunsch.â€ 

Ray turned the card over, examined the postmark, and then began to
laugh.

â€œConcord, Kansas. He has my sympathy!â€ 

â€œWhy, is that a poor town?â€ 

â€œItâ€™s the jumping-off place, no town at all. Some houses dumped down in
the middle of a cornfield. You get lost in the corn. Not even a saloon
to keep things going; sell whiskey without a license at the butcher
shop, beer on ice with the liver and beefsteak. I wouldnâ€™t stay there
over Sunday for a ten-dollar bill.â€ 

â€œOh, dear! What do you suppose heâ€™s doing there? Maybe he just stopped
off there a few days to tune pianos,â€  Thea suggested hopefully.

Ray gave her back the card. â€œHeâ€™s headed in the wrong direction. What
does he want to get back into a grass country for? Now, there are lots
of good live towns down on the Santa FÃ©, and everybody down there is
musical. He could always get a job playing in saloons if he was dead
broke. Iâ€™ve figured out that Iâ€™ve got no years of my life to waste in a
Methodist country where they raise pork.â€ 

â€œWe must stop on our way back and show this card to Mrs. Kohler. She
misses him so.â€ 

â€œBy the way, Thee, I hear the old woman goes to church every Sunday to
hear you sing. Fritz tells me he has to wait till two oâ€™clock for his
Sunday dinner these days. The church people ought to give you credit
for that, when they go for you.â€ 

Thea shook her head and spoke in a tone of resignation. â€œTheyâ€™ll always
go for me, just as they did for Wunsch. It wasnâ€™t because he drank they
went for him; not really. It was something else.â€ 

â€œYou want to salt your money down, Thee, and go to Chicago and take
some lessons. Then you come back, and wear a long feather and high
heels and put on a few airs, and thatâ€™ll fix â€™em. Thatâ€™s what they
like.â€ 

â€œIâ€™ll never have money enough to go to Chicago. Mother meant to lend me
some, I think, but now theyâ€™ve got hard times back in Nebraska, and her
farm donâ€™t bring her in anything. Takes all the tenant can raise to pay
the taxes. Donâ€™t letâ€™s talk about that. You promised to tell me about
the play you went to see in Denver.â€ 

Any one would have liked to hear Rayâ€™s simple and clear account of the
performance he had seen at the Tabor Grand Opera Houseâ€”Maggie Mitchell
in _Little Barefoot_â€”and any one would have liked to watch his kind
face. Ray looked his best out of doors, when his thick red hands were
covered by gloves, and the dull red of his sunburned face somehow
seemed right in the light and wind. He looked better, too, with his hat
on; his hair was thin and dry, with no particular color or character,
â€œregular Willy-boy hair,â€  as he himself described it. His eyes were
pale beside the reddish bronze of his skin. They had the faded look
often seen in the eyes of men who have lived much in the sun and wind
and who have been accustomed to train their vision upon distant
objects.

Ray realized that Theaâ€™s life was dull and exacting, and that she
missed Wunsch. He knew she worked hard, that she put up with a great
many little annoyances, and that her duties as a teacher separated her
more than ever from the boys and girls of her own age. He did
everything he could to provide recreation for her. He brought her candy
and magazines and pineapplesâ€”of which she was very fondâ€”from Denver,
and kept his eyes and ears open for anything that might interest her.
He was, of course, living for Thea. He had thought it all out carefully
and had made up his mind just when he would speak to her. When she was
seventeen, then he would tell her his plan and ask her to marry him. He
would be willing to wait two, or even three years, until she was
twenty, if she thought best. By that time he would surely have got in
on something: copper, oil, gold, silver, sheep,â€”something.

Meanwhile, it was pleasure enough to feel that she depended on him more
and more, that she leaned upon his steady kindness. He never broke
faith with himself about her; he never hinted to her of his hopes for
the future, never suggested that she might be more intimately
confidential with him, or talked to her of the thing he thought about
so constantly. He had the chivalry which is perhaps the proudest
possession of his race. He had never embarrassed her by so much as a
glance. Sometimes, when they drove out to the sand hills, he let his
left arm lie along the back of the buggy seat, but it never came any
nearer to Thea than that, never touched her. He often turned to her a
face full of pride, and frank admiration, but his glance was never so
intimate or so penetrating as Dr. Archieâ€™s. His blue eyes were clear
and shallow, friendly, uninquiring. He rested Thea because he was so
different; because, though he often told her interesting things, he
never set lively fancies going in her head; because he never
misunderstood her, and because he never, by any chance, for a single
instant, understood her! Yes, with Ray she was safe; by him she would
never be discovered!




XVI


The pleasantest experience Thea had that summer was a trip that she and
her mother made to Denver in Ray Kennedyâ€™s caboose. Mrs. Kronborg had
been looking forward to this excursion for a long while, but as Ray
never knew at what hour his freight would leave Moonstone, it was
difficult to arrange. The call-boy was as likely to summon him to start
on his run at twelve oâ€™clock midnight as at twelve oâ€™clock noon. The
first week in June started out with all the scheduled trains running on
time, and a light freight business. Tuesday evening Ray, after
consulting with the dispatcher, stopped at the Kronborgsâ€™ front gate to
tell Mrs. Kronborgâ€”who was helping Tillie water the flowersâ€”that if she
and Thea could be at the depot at eight oâ€™clock the next morning, he
thought he could promise them a pleasant ride and get them into Denver
before nine oâ€™clock in the evening. Mrs. Kronborg told him cheerfully,
across the fence, that she would â€œtake him up on it,â€  and Ray hurried
back to the yards to scrub out his car.

The one complaint Rayâ€™s brakemen had to make of him was that he was too
fussy about his caboose. His former brakeman had asked to be
transferred because, he said, â€œKennedy was as fussy about his car as an
old maid about her bird-cage.â€  Joe Giddy, who was braking with Ray now,
called him â€œthe bride,â€  because he kept the caboose and bunks so clean.

It was properly the brakemanâ€™s business to keep the car clean, but when
Ray got back to the depot, Giddy was nowhere to be found. Muttering
that all his brakemen seemed to consider him â€œeasy,â€  Ray went down to
his car alone. He built a fire in the stove and put water on to heat
while he got into his overalls and jumper. Then he set to work with a
scrubbing-brush and plenty of soap and â€œcleaner.â€  He scrubbed the floor
and seats, blacked the stove, put clean sheets on the bunks, and then
began to demolish Giddyâ€™s picture gallery. Ray found that his brakemen
were likely to have what he termed â€œa taste for the nude in art,â€  and
Giddy was no exception. Ray took down half a dozen girls in tights and
ballet skirts,â€”premiums for cigarette coupons,â€”and some racy calendars
advertising saloons and sporting clubs, which had cost Giddy both time
and trouble; he even removed Giddyâ€™s particular pet, a naked girl lying
on a couch with her knee carelessly poised in the air. Underneath the
picture was printed the title, â€œThe Odalisque.â€  Giddy was under the
happy delusion that this title meant something wicked,â€”there was a
wicked look about the consonants,â€”but Ray, of course, had looked it up,
and Giddy was indebted to the dictionary for the privilege of keeping
his lady. If â€œodalisqueâ€  had been what Ray called an objectionable
word, he would have thrown the picture out in the first place. Ray even
took down a picture of Mrs. Langtry in evening dress, because it was
entitled the â€œJersey Lily,â€  and because there was a small head of
Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, in one corner. Albert Edwardâ€™s
conduct was a popular subject of discussion among railroad men in those
days, and as Ray pulled the tacks out of this lithograph he felt more
indignant with the English than ever. He deposited all these pictures
under the mattress of Giddyâ€™s bunk, and stood admiring his clean car in
the lamplight; the walls now exhibited only a wheatfield, advertising
agricultural implements, a map of Colorado, and some pictures of
race-horses and hunting-dogs. At this moment Giddy, freshly shaved and
shampooed, his shirt shining with the highest polish known to Chinese
laundrymen, his straw hat tipped over his right eye, thrust his head in
at the door.

â€œWhat in hellâ€”â€  he brought out furiously. His good humored, sunburned
face seemed fairly to swell with amazement and anger.

â€œThatâ€™s all right, Giddy,â€  Ray called in a conciliatory tone. â€œNothing
injured. Iâ€™ll put â€™em all up again as I found â€™em. Going to take some
ladies down in the car to-morrow.â€ 

Giddy scowled. He did not dispute the propriety of Rayâ€™s measures, if
there were to be ladies on board, but he felt injured. â€œI suppose
youâ€™ll expect me to behave like a Y.M.C.A. secretary,â€  he growled. â€œI
canâ€™t do my work and serve tea at the same time.â€ 

â€œNo need to have a tea-party,â€  said Ray with determined cheerfulness.
â€œMrs. Kronborg will bring the lunch, and it will be a darned good one.â€ 

Giddy lounged against the car, holding his cigar between two thick
fingers. â€œThen I guess sheâ€™ll get it,â€  he observed knowingly. â€œI donâ€™t
think your musical friend is much on the grub-box. Has to keep her
hands white to tickle the ivories.â€  Giddy had nothing against Thea, but
he felt cantankerous and wanted to get a rise out of Kennedy.

â€œEvery man to his own job,â€  Ray replied agreeably, pulling his white
shirt on over his head.

Giddy emitted smoke disdainfully. â€œI suppose so. The man that gets her
will have to wear an apron and bake the pancakes. Well, some men like
to mess about the kitchen.â€  He paused, but Ray was intent on getting
into his clothes as quickly as possible. Giddy thought he could go a
little further. â€œOf course, I donâ€™t dispute your right to haul women in
this car if you want to; but personally, so far as Iâ€™m concerned, Iâ€™d a
good deal rather drink a can of tomatoes and do without the women _and_
their lunch. I was never much enslaved to hard-boiled eggs, anyhow.â€ 

â€œYouâ€™ll eat â€™em to-morrow, all the same.â€  Rayâ€™s tone had a steely
glitter as he jumped out of the car, and Giddy stood aside to let him
pass. He knew that Kennedyâ€™s next reply would be delivered by hand. He
had once seen Ray beat up a nasty fellow for insulting a Mexican woman
who helped about the grub-car in the work train, and his fists had
worked like two steel hammers. Giddy wasnâ€™t looking for trouble.

At eight oâ€™clock the next morning Ray greeted his ladies and helped
them into the car. Giddy had put on a clean shirt and yellow pig-skin
gloves and was whistling his best. He considered Kennedy a fluke as a
ladiesâ€™ man, and if there was to be a party, the honors had to be done
by some one who wasnâ€™t a blacksmith at small-talk. Giddy had, as Ray
sarcastically admitted, â€œa local reputation as a jollier,â€  and he was
fluent in gallant speeches of a not too-veiled nature. He insisted that
Thea should take his seat in the cupola, opposite Rayâ€™s, where she
could look out over the country. Thea told him, as she clambered up,
that she cared a good deal more about riding in that seat than about
going to Denver. Ray was never so companionable and easy as when he sat
chatting in the lookout of his little house on wheels. Good stories
came to him, and interesting recollections. Thea had a great respect
for the reports he had to write out, and for the telegrams that were
handed to him at stations; for all the knowledge and experience it must
take to run a freight train.

Giddy, down in the car, in the pauses of his work, made himself
agreeable to Mrs. Kronborg.

â€œItâ€™s a great rest to be where my family canâ€™t get at me, Mr. Giddy,â€ 
she told him. â€œI thought you and Ray might have some housework here for
me to look after, but I couldnâ€™t improve any on this car.â€ 

â€œOh, we like to keep her neat,â€  returned Giddy glibly, winking up at
Rayâ€™s expressive back. â€œIf you want to see a clean ice-box, look at
this one. Yes, Kennedy always carries fresh cream to eat on his
oatmeal. Iâ€™m not particular. The tin cowâ€™s good enough for me.â€ 

â€œMost of you boys smoke so much that all victuals taste alike to you,â€ 
said Mrs. Kronborg. â€œIâ€™ve got no religious scruples against smoking,
but I couldnâ€™t take as much interest cooking for a man that used
tobacco. I guess itâ€™s all right for bachelors who have to eat round.â€ 

Mrs. Kronborg took off her hat and veil and made herself comfortable.
She seldom had an opportunity to be idle, and she enjoyed it. She could
sit for hours and watch the sage-hens fly up and the jack-rabbits dart
away from the track, without being bored. She wore a tan bombazine
dress, made very plainly, and carried a roomy, worn,
mother-of-the-family handbag.

Ray Kennedy always insisted that Mrs. Kronborg was â€œa fine-looking
lady,â€  but this was not the common opinion in Moonstone. Ray had lived
long enough among the Mexicans to dislike fussiness, to feel that there
was something more attractive in ease of manner than in absentminded
concern about hairpins and dabs of lace. He had learned to think that
the way a woman stood, moved, sat in her chair, looked at you, was more
important than the absence of wrinkles from her skirt. Ray had, indeed,
such unusual perceptions in some directions, that one could not help
wondering what he would have been if he had ever, as he said, had â€œhalf
a chance.â€ 

He was right; Mrs. Kronborg was a fine-looking woman. She was short and
square, but her head was a real head, not a mere jerky termination of
the body. It had some individuality apart from hats and hairpins. Her
hair, Moonstone women admitted, would have been very pretty â€œon anybody
else.â€  Frizzy bangs were worn then, but Mrs. Kronborg always dressed
her hair in the same way, parted in the middle, brushed smoothly back
from her low, white forehead, pinned loosely on the back of her head in
two thick braids. It was growing gray about the temples, but after the
manner of yellow hair it seemed only to have grown paler there, and had
taken on a color like that of English primroses. Her eyes were clear
and untroubled; her face smooth and calm, and, as Ray said, â€œstrong.â€ 

Thea and Ray, up in the sunny cupola, were laughing and talking. Ray
got great pleasure out of seeing her face there in the little box where
he so often imagined it. They were crossing a plateau where great red
sandstone boulders lay about, most of them much wider at the top than
at the base, so that they looked like great toadstools.

â€œThe sand has been blowing against them for a good many hundred years,â€ 
Ray explained, directing Theaâ€™s eyes with his gloved hand. â€œYou see the
sand blows low, being so heavy, and cuts them out underneath. Wind and
sand are pretty high-class architects. Thatâ€™s the principle of most of
the Cliff-Dweller remains down at Canyon de Chelly. The sandstorms had
dug out big depressions in the face of a cliff, and the Indians built
their houses back in that depression.â€ 

â€œYou told me that before, Ray, and of course you know. But the
geography says their houses were cut out of the face of the living
rock, and I like that better.â€ 

Ray sniffed. â€œWhat nonsense does get printed! Itâ€™s enough to give a man
disrespect for learning. How could them Indians cut houses out of the
living rock, when they knew nothing about the art of forging metals?â€ 
Ray leaned back in his chair, swung his foot, and looked thoughtful and
happy. He was in one of his favorite fields of speculation, and nothing
gave him more pleasure than talking these things over with Thea
Kronborg. â€œIâ€™ll tell you, Thee, if those old fellows had learned to
work metals once, your ancient Egyptians and Assyrians wouldnâ€™t have
beat them very much. Whatever they did do, they did well. Their
masonryâ€™s standing there to-day, the corners as true as the Denver
Capitol. They were clever at most everything but metals; and that one
failure kept them from getting across. It was the quicksand that
swallowed â€™em up, as a race. I guess civilization proper began when men
mastered metals.â€ 

Ray was not vain about his bookish phrases. He did not use them to show
off, but because they seemed to him more adequate than colloquial
speech. He felt strongly about these things, and groped for words, as
he said, â€œto express himself.â€  He had the lamentable American belief
that â€œexpressionâ€  is obligatory. He still carried in his trunk, among
the unrelated possessions of a railroad man, a notebook on the
title-page of which was written â€œImpressions on First Viewing the Grand
Canyon, Ray H. Kennedy.â€  The pages of that book were like a
battlefield; the laboring author had fallen back from metaphor after
metaphor, abandoned position after position. He would have admitted
that the art of forging metals was nothing to this treacherous business
of recording impressions, in which the material you were so full of
vanished mysteriously under your striving hand. â€œEscaping steam!â€  he
had said to himself, the last time he tried to read that notebook.

Thea didnâ€™t mind Rayâ€™s travel-lecture expressions. She dodged them,
unconsciously, as she did her fatherâ€™s professional palaver. The light
in Rayâ€™s pale-blue eyes and the feeling in his voice more than made up
for the stiffness of his language.

â€œWere the Cliff-Dwellers really clever with their hands, Ray, or do you
always have to make allowance and say, â€˜That was pretty good for an
Indianâ€™?â€  she asked.

Ray went down into the car to give some instructions to Giddy. â€œWell,â€ 
he said when he returned, â€œabout the aborigines: once or twice Iâ€™ve
been with some fellows who were cracking burial mounds. Always felt a
little ashamed of it, but we did pull out some remarkable things. We
got some pottery out whole; seemed pretty fine to me. I guess their
women were their artists. We found lots of old shoes and sandals made
out of yucca fiber, neat and strong; and feather blankets, too.â€ 

â€œFeather blankets? You never told me about them.â€ 

â€œDidnâ€™t I? The old fellowsâ€”or the squawsâ€”wove a close netting of yucca
fiber, and then tied on little bunches of down feathers, overlapping,
just the way feathers grow on a bird. Some of them were feathered on
both sides. You canâ€™t get anything warmer than that, now, can you?â€”or
prettier. What I like about those old aborigines is, that they got all
their ideas from nature.â€ 

Thea laughed. â€œThat means youâ€™re going to say something about girlsâ€™
wearing corsets. But some of your Indians flattened their babiesâ€™
heads, and thatâ€™s worse than wearing corsets.â€ 

â€œGive me an Indian girlâ€™s figure for beauty,â€  Ray insisted. â€œAnd a girl
with a voice like yours ought to have plenty of lung-action. But you
know my sentiments on that subject. I was going to tell you about the
handsomest thing we ever looted out of those burial mounds. It was on a
woman, too, I regret to say. She was preserved as perfect as any mummy
that ever came out of the pyramids. She had a big string of turquoises
around her neck, and she was wrapped in a fox-fur cloak, lined with
little yellow feathers that must have come off wild canaries. Can you
beat that, now? The fellow that claimed it sold it to a Boston man for
a hundred and fifty dollars.â€ 

Thea looked at him admiringly. â€œOh, Ray, and didnâ€™t you get anything
off her, to remember her by, even? She must have been a princess.â€ 

Ray took a wallet from the pocket of the coat that was hanging beside
him, and drew from it a little lump wrapped in worn tissue paper. In a
moment a stone, soft and blue as a robinâ€™s egg, lay in the hard palm of
his hand. It was a turquoise, rubbed smooth in the Indian finish, which
is so much more beautiful than the incongruous high polish the white
man gives that tender stone. â€œI got this from her necklace. See the
hole where the string went through? You know how the Indians drill
them? Work the drill with their teeth. You like it, donâ€™t you? Theyâ€™re
just right for you. Blue and yellow are the Swedish colors.â€  Ray looked
intently at her head, bent over his hand, and then gave his whole
attention to the track.

â€œIâ€™ll tell you, Thee,â€  he began after a pause, â€œIâ€™m going to form a
camping party one of these days and persuade your _padre_ to take you
and your mother down to that country, and weâ€™ll live in the rock
housesâ€”theyâ€™re as comfortable as can beâ€”and start the cook fires up in
â€™em once again. Iâ€™ll go into the burial mounds and get you more
keepsakes than any girl ever had before.â€  Ray had planned such an
expedition for his wedding journey, and it made his heart thump to see
how Theaâ€™s eyes kindled when he talked about it. â€œIâ€™ve learned more
down there about what makes history,â€  he went on, â€œthan in all the
books Iâ€™ve ever read. When you sit in the sun and let your heels hang
out of a doorway that drops a thousand feet, ideas come to you. You
begin to feel what the human race has been up against from the
beginning. Thereâ€™s something mighty elevating about those old
habitations. You feel like itâ€™s up to you to do your best, on account
of those fellows having it so hard. You feel like you owed them
something.â€ 

At Wassiwappa, Ray got instructions to sidetrack until Thirty-six went
by. After reading the message, he turned to his guests. â€œIâ€™m afraid
this will hold us up about two hours, Mrs. Kronborg, and we wonâ€™t get
into Denver till near midnight.â€ 

â€œThat wonâ€™t trouble me,â€  said Mrs. Kronborg contentedly. â€œThey know me
at the Y.W.C.A., and theyâ€™ll let me in any time of night. I came to see
the country, not to make time. Iâ€™ve always wanted to get out at this
white place and look around, and now Iâ€™ll have a chance. What makes it
so white?â€ 

â€œSome kind of chalky rock.â€  Ray sprang to the ground and gave Mrs.
Kronborg his hand. â€œYou can get soil of any color in Colorado; match
most any ribbon.â€ 

While Ray was getting his train on to a side track, Mrs. Kronborg
strolled off to examine the post-office and station house; these, with
the water tank, made up the town. The station agent â€œbatchedâ€  and
raised chickens. He ran out to meet Mrs. Kronborg, clutched at her
feverishly, and began telling her at once how lonely he was and what
bad luck he was having with his poultry. She went to his chicken yard
with him, and prescribed for gapes.

Wassiwappa seemed a dreary place enough to people who looked for
verdure, a brilliant place to people who liked color. Beside the
station house there was a blue-grass plot, protected by a red plank
fence, and six fly-bitten box-elder trees, not much larger than bushes,
were kept alive by frequent hosings from the water plug. Over the
windows some dusty morning-glory vines were trained on strings. All the
country about was broken up into low chalky hills, which were so
intensely white, and spotted so evenly with sage, that they looked like
white leopards crouching. White dust powdered everything, and the light
was so intense that the station agent usually wore blue glasses. Behind
the station there was a water course, which roared in flood time, and a
basin in the soft white rock where a pool of alkali water flashed in
the sun like a mirror. The agent looked almost as sick as his chickens,
and Mrs. Kronborg at once invited him to lunch with her party. He had,
he confessed, a distaste for his own cooking, and lived mainly on soda
crackers and canned beef. He laughed apologetically when Mrs. Kronborg
said she guessed sheâ€™d look about for a shady place to eat lunch.

She walked up the track to the water tank, and there, in the narrow
shadows cast by the uprights on which the tank stood, she found two
tramps. They sat up and stared at her, heavy with sleep. When she asked
them where they were going, they told her â€œto the coast.â€  They rested
by day and traveled by night; walked the ties unless they could steal a
ride, they said; adding that â€œthese Western roads were getting strict.â€ 
Their faces were blistered, their eyes blood-shot, and their shoes
looked fit only for the trash pile.

â€œI suppose youâ€™re hungry?â€  Mrs. Kronborg asked. â€œI suppose you both
drink?â€  she went on thoughtfully, not censoriously.

The huskier of the two hoboes, a bushy, bearded fellow, rolled his eyes
and said, â€œI wonder?â€  But the other, who was old and spare, with a
sharp nose and watery eyes, sighed. â€œSome has one affliction, some
another,â€  he said.

Mrs. Kronborg reflected. â€œWell,â€  she said at last, â€œyou canâ€™t get
liquor here, anyway. I am going to ask you to vacate, because I want to
have a little picnic under this tank for the freight crew that brought
me along. I wish I had lunch enough to provide you, but I ainâ€™t. The
station agent says he gets his provisions over there at the post office
store, and if you are hungry you can get some canned stuff there.â€  She
opened her handbag and gave each of the tramps a half-dollar.

The old man wiped his eyes with his forefinger. â€œThank â€™ee, maâ€™am. A
can of tomatters will taste pretty good to me. I wasnâ€™t always walkinâ€™
ties; I had a good job in Cleveland beforeâ€”â€ 

The hairy tramp turned on him fiercely. â€œAw, shut up on that, grandpaw!
Ainâ€™t you got no gratitude? What do you want to hand the lady that
fur?â€ 

The old man hung his head and turned away. As he went off, his comrade
looked after him and said to Mrs. Kronborg: â€œItâ€™s true, what he says.
He had a job in the car shops; but he had bad luck.â€  They both limped
away toward the store, and Mrs. Kronborg sighed. She was not afraid of
tramps. She always talked to them, and never turned one away. She hated
to think how many of them there were, crawling along the tracks over
that vast country.

Her reflections were cut short by Ray and Giddy and Thea, who came
bringing the lunch box and water bottles. Although there was not shadow
enough to accommodate all the party at once, the air under the tank was
distinctly cooler than the surrounding air, and the drip made a
pleasant sound in that breathless noon. The station agent ate as if he
had never been fed before, apologizing every time he took another piece
of fried chicken. Giddy was unabashed before the devilled eggs of which
he had spoken so scornfully last night. After lunch the men lit their
pipes and lay back against the uprights that supported the tank.

â€œThis is the sunny side of railroading, all right,â€  Giddy drawled
luxuriously.

â€œYou fellows grumble too much,â€  said Mrs. Kronborg as she corked the
pickle jar. â€œYour job has its drawbacks, but it donâ€™t tie you down. Of
course thereâ€™s the risk; but I believe a manâ€™s watched over, and he
canâ€™t be hurt on the railroad or anywhere else if itâ€™s intended he
shouldnâ€™t be.â€ 

Giddy laughed. â€œThen the trains must be operated by fellows the Lord
has it in for, Mrs. Kronborg. They figure it out that a railroad manâ€™s
only due to last eleven years; then itâ€™s his turn to be smashed.â€ 

â€œThatâ€™s a dark Providence, I donâ€™t deny,â€  Mrs. Kronborg admitted. â€œBut
thereâ€™s lots of things in life thatâ€™s hard to understand.â€ 

â€œI guess!â€  murmured Giddy, looking off at the spotted white hills.

Ray smoked in silence, watching Thea and her mother clear away the
lunch. He was thinking that Mrs. Kronborg had in her face the same
serious look that Thea had; only hers was calm and satisfied, and
Theaâ€™s was intense and questioning. But in both it was a large kind of
look, that was not all the time being broken up and convulsed by
trivial things. They both carried their heads like Indian women, with a
kind of noble unconsciousness. He got so tired of women who were always
nodding and jerking; apologizing, deprecating, coaxing, insinuating
with their heads.

When Rayâ€™s party set off again that afternoon the sun beat fiercely
into the cupola, and Thea curled up in one of the seats at the back of
the car and had a nap.

As the short twilight came on, Giddy took a turn in the cupola, and Ray
came down and sat with Thea on the rear platform of the caboose and
watched the darkness come in soft waves over the plain. They were now
about thirty miles from Denver, and the mountains looked very near. The
great toothed wall behind which the sun had gone down now separated
into four distinct ranges, one behind the other. They were a very pale
blue, a color scarcely stronger than wood smoke, and the sunset had
left bright streaks in the snow-filled gorges. In the clear,
yellow-streaked sky the stars were coming out, flickering like newly
lighted lamps, growing steadier and more golden as the sky darkened and
the land beneath them fell into complete shadow. It was a cool, restful
darkness that was not black or forbidding, but somehow open and free;
the night of high plains where there is no moistness or mistiness in
the atmosphere.

Ray lit his pipe. â€œI never get tired of them old stars, Thee. I miss
â€™em up in Washington and Oregon where itâ€™s misty. Like â€™em best down in
Mother Mexico, where they have everything their own way. Iâ€™m not for
any country where the stars are dim.â€  Ray paused and drew on his pipe.
â€œI donâ€™t know as I ever really noticed â€™em much till that first year I
herded sheep up in Wyoming. That was the year the blizzard caught me.â€ 

â€œAnd you lost all your sheep, didnâ€™t you, Ray?â€  Thea spoke
sympathetically. â€œWas the man who owned them nice about it?â€ 

â€œYes, he was a good loser. But I didnâ€™t get over it for a long while.
Sheep are so damned resigned. Sometimes, to this day, when Iâ€™m
dog-tired, I try to save them sheep all night long. It comes kind of
hard on a boy when he first finds out how little he is, and how big
everything else is.â€ 

Thea moved restlessly toward him and dropped her chin on her hand,
looking at a low star that seemed to rest just on the rim of the earth.
â€œI donâ€™t see how you stood it. I donâ€™t believe I could. I donâ€™t see how
people can stand it to get knocked out, anyhow!â€  She spoke with such
fierceness that Ray glanced at her in surprise. She was sitting on the
floor of the car, crouching like a little animal about to spring.

â€œNo occasion for you to see,â€  he said warmly. â€œThereâ€™ll always be
plenty of other people to take the knocks for you.â€ 

â€œThatâ€™s nonsense, Ray.â€  Thea spoke impatiently and leaned lower still,
frowning at the red star. â€œEverybodyâ€™s up against it for himself,
succeeds or failsâ€”himself.â€ 

â€œIn one way, yes,â€  Ray admitted, knocking the sparks from his pipe out
into the soft darkness that seemed to flow like a river beside the car.
â€œBut when you look at it another way, there are a lot of halfway people
in this world who help the winners win, and the failers fail. If a man
stumbles, thereâ€™s plenty of people to push him down. But if heâ€™s like
â€˜the youth who bore,â€™ those same people are foreordained to help him
along. They may hate to, worse than blazes, and they may do a lot of
cussinâ€™ about it, but they have to help the winners and they canâ€™t
dodge it. Itâ€™s a natural law, like what keeps the big clock up there
going, little wheels and big, and no mix-up.â€  Rayâ€™s hand and his pipe
were suddenly outlined against the sky. â€œEver occur to you, Thee, that
they have to be on time close enough to _make time?_ The Dispatcher up
there must have a long head.â€  Pleased with his similitude, Ray went
back to the lookout. Going into Denver, he had to keep a sharp watch.

Giddy came down, cheerful at the prospect of getting into port, and
singing a new topical ditty that had come up from the Santa FÃ© by way
of La Junta. Nobody knows who makes these songs; they seem to follow
events automatically. Mrs. Kronborg made Giddy sing the whole twelve
verses of this one, and laughed until she wiped her eyes. The story was
that of Katie Casey, head diningroom girl at Winslow, Arizona, who was
unjustly discharged by the Harvey House manager. Her suitor, the
yardmaster, took the switchmen out on a strike until she was
reinstated. Freight trains from the east and the west piled up at
Winslow until the yards looked like a log-jam. The division
superintendent, who was in California, had to wire instructions for
Katie Caseyâ€™s restoration before he could get his trains running.
Giddyâ€™s song told all this with much detail, both tender and technical,
and after each of the dozen verses came the refrain:â€”

â€œOh, who would think that Katie Casey owned the Santa FÃ©?
But it really looks that way,
The dispatcherâ€™s turninâ€™ gray,
All the crews is off their pay;
She can hold the freight from Albuquerqâ€™ to Needles any day;
The division superintendent, he come home from Monterey,
Just to see if things was pleasinâ€™ Katie Caâ€”aâ€”aâ€”sey.â€ 


Thea laughed with her mother and applauded Giddy. Everything was so
kindly and comfortable; Giddy and Ray, and their hospitable little
house, and the easy-going country, and the stars. She curled up on the
seat again with that warm, sleepy feeling of the friendliness of the
worldâ€”which nobody keeps very long, and which she was to lose early and
irrevocably.

The summer flew by. Thea was glad when Ray Kennedy had a Sunday in town
and could take her driving. Out among the sand hills she could forget
the â€œnew roomâ€  which was the scene of wearing and fruitless labor. Dr.
Archie was away from home a good deal that year. He had put all his
money into mines above Colorado Springs, and he hoped for great returns
from them.

In the fall of that year, Mr. Kronborg decided that Thea ought to show
more interest in church work. He put it to her frankly, one night at
supper, before the whole family. â€œHow can I insist on the other girls
in the congregation being active in the work, when one of my own
daughters manifests so little interest?â€ 

â€œBut I sing every Sunday morning, and I have to give up one night a
week to choir practice,â€  Thea declared rebelliously, pushing back her
plate with an angry determination to eat nothing more.

â€œOne night a week is not enough for the pastorâ€™s daughter,â€  her father
replied. â€œYou wonâ€™t do anything in the sewing society, and you wonâ€™t
take part in the Christian Endeavor or the Band of Hope. Very well, you
must make it up in other ways. I want some one to play the organ and
lead the singing at prayer-meeting this winter. Deacon Potter told me
some time ago that he thought there would be more interest in our
prayer-meetings if we had the organ. Miss Meyers donâ€™t feel that she
can play on Wednesday nights. And there ought to be somebody to start
the hymns. Mrs. Potter is getting old, and she always starts them too
high. It wonâ€™t take much of your time, and it will keep people from
talking.â€ 

This argument conquered Thea, though she left the table sullenly. The
fear of the tongue, that terror of little towns, is usually felt more
keenly by the ministerâ€™s family than by other households. Whenever the
Kronborgs wanted to do anything, even to buy a new carpet, they had to
take counsel together as to whether people would talk. Mrs. Kronborg
had her own conviction that people talked when they felt like it, and
said what they chose, no matter how the ministerâ€™s family conducted
themselves. But she did not impart these dangerous ideas to her
children. Thea was still under the belief that public opinion could be
placated; that if you clucked often enough, the hens would mistake you
for one of themselves.

Mrs. Kronborg did not have any particular zest for prayer-meetings, and
she stayed at home whenever she had a valid excuse. Thor was too old to
furnish such an excuse now, so every Wednesday night, unless one of the
children was sick, she trudged off with Thea, behind Mr. Kronborg. At
first Thea was terribly bored. But she got used to prayer-meeting, got
even to feel a mournful interest in it.

The exercises were always pretty much the same. After the first hymn
her father read a passage from the Bible, usually a Psalm. Then there
was another hymn, and then her father commented upon the passage he had
read and, as he said, â€œapplied the Word to our necessities.â€  After a
third hymn, the meeting was declared open, and the old men and women
took turns at praying and talking. Mrs. Kronborg never spoke in
meeting. She told people firmly that she had been brought up to keep
silent and let the men talk, but she gave respectful attention to the
others, sitting with her hands folded in her lap.

The prayer-meeting audience was always small. The young and energetic
members of the congregation came only once or twice a year, â€œto keep
people from talking.â€  The usual Wednesday night gathering was made up
of old women, with perhaps six or eight old men, and a few sickly girls
who had not much interest in life; two of them, indeed, were already
preparing to die. Thea accepted the mournfulness of the prayer-meetings
as a kind of spiritual discipline, like funerals. She always read late
after she went home and felt a stronger wish than usual to live and to
be happy.

The meetings were conducted in the Sunday-School room, where there were
wooden chairs instead of pews; an old map of Palestine hung on the
wall, and the bracket lamps gave out only a dim light. The old women
sat motionless as Indians in their shawls and bonnets; some of them
wore long black mourning veils. The old men drooped in their chairs.
Every back, every face, every head said â€œresignation.â€  Often there were
long silences, when you could hear nothing but the crackling of the
soft coal in the stove and the muffled cough of one of the sick girls.

There was one nice old lady,â€”tall, erect, self-respecting, with a
delicate white face and a soft voice. She never whined, and what she
said was always cheerful, though she spoke so nervously that Thea knew
she dreaded getting up, and that she made a real sacrifice to, as she
said, â€œtestify to the goodness of her Saviour.â€  She was the mother of
the girl who coughed, and Thea used to wonder how she explained things
to herself. There was, indeed, only one woman who talked because she
was, as Mr. Kronborg said, â€œtonguey.â€  The others were somehow
impressive. They told about the sweet thoughts that came to them while
they were at their work; how, amid their household tasks, they were
suddenly lifted by the sense of a divine Presence. Sometimes they told
of their first conversion, of how in their youth that higher Power had
made itself known to them. Old Mr. Carsen, the carpenter, who gave his
services as janitor to the church, used often to tell how, when he was
a young man and a scoffer, bent on the destruction of both body and
soul, his Saviour had come to him in the Michigan woods and had stood,
it seemed to him, beside the tree he was felling; and how he dropped
his axe and knelt in prayer â€œto Him who died for us upon the tree.â€ 
Thea always wanted to ask him more about it; about his mysterious
wickedness, and about the vision.

Sometimes the old people would ask for prayers for their absent
children. Sometimes they asked their brothers and sisters in Christ to
pray that they might be stronger against temptations. One of the sick
girls used to ask them to pray that she might have more faith in the
times of depression that came to her, â€œwhen all the way before seemed
dark.â€  She repeated that husky phrase so often, that Thea always
remembered it.

One old woman, who never missed a Wednesday night, and who nearly
always took part in the meeting, came all the way up from the depot
settlement. She always wore a black crocheted â€œfascinatorâ€  over her
thin white hair, and she made long, tremulous prayers, full of railroad
terminology. She had six sons in the service of different railroads,
and she always prayed â€œfor the boys on the road, who know not at what
moment they may be cut off. When, in Thy divine wisdom, their hour is
upon them, may they, O our Heavenly Father, see only white lights along
the road to Eternity.â€  She used to speak, too, of â€œthe engines that
race with deathâ€ ; and though she looked so old and little when she was
on her knees, and her voice was so shaky, her prayers had a thrill of
speed and danger in them; they made one think of the deep black
canyons, the slender trestles, the pounding trains. Thea liked to look
at her sunken eyes that seemed full of wisdom, at her black thread
gloves, much too long in the fingers and so meekly folded one over the
other. Her face was brown, and worn away as rocks are worn by water.
There are many ways of describing that color of age, but in reality it
is not like parchment, or like any of the things it is said to be like.
That brownness and that texture of skin are found only in the faces of
old human creatures, who have worked hard and who have always been
poor.

One bitterly cold night in December the prayer-meeting seemed to Thea
longer than usual. The prayers and the talks went on and on. It was as
if the old people were afraid to go out into the cold, or were
stupefied by the hot air of the room. She had left a book at home that
she was impatient to get back to. At last the Doxology was sung, but
the old people lingered about the stove to greet each other, and Thea
took her motherâ€™s arm and hurried out to the frozen sidewalk, before
her father could get away. The wind was whistling up the street and
whipping the naked cottonwood trees against the telegraph poles and the
sides of the houses. Thin snow clouds were flying overhead, so that the
sky looked gray, with a dull phosphorescence. The icy streets and the
shingle roofs of the houses were gray, too. All along the street,
shutters banged or windows rattled, or gates wobbled, held by their
latch but shaking on loose hinges. There was not a cat or a dog in
Moonstone that night that was not given a warm shelter; the cats under
the kitchen stove, the dogs in barns or coal-sheds. When Thea and her
mother reached home, their mufflers were covered with ice, where their
breath had frozen. They hurried into the house and made a dash for the
parlor and the hard-coal burner, behind which Gunner was sitting on a
stool, reading his Jules Verne book. The door stood open into the
dining-room, which was heated from the parlor. Mr. Kronborg always had
a lunch when he came home from prayer-meeting, and his pumpkin pie and
milk were set out on the dining-table. Mrs. Kronborg said she thought
she felt hungry, too, and asked Thea if she didnâ€™t want something to
eat.

â€œNo, Iâ€™m not hungry, mother. I guess Iâ€™ll go upstairs.â€ 

â€œI expect youâ€™ve got some book up there,â€  said Mrs. Kronborg, bringing
out another pie. â€œYouâ€™d better bring it down here and read. Nobodyâ€™ll
disturb you, and itâ€™s terrible cold up in that loft.â€ 

Thea was always assured that no one would disturb her if she read
downstairs, but the boys talked when they came in, and her father
fairly delivered discourses after he had been renewed by half a pie and
a pitcher of milk.

â€œI donâ€™t mind the cold. Iâ€™ll take a hot brick up for my feet. I put one
in the stove before I left, if one of the boys hasnâ€™t stolen it.
Good-night, mother.â€  Thea got her brick and lantern, and dashed
upstairs through the windy loft. She undressed at top speed and got
into bed with her brick. She put a pair of white knitted gloves on her
hands, and pinned over her head a piece of soft flannel that had been
one of Thorâ€™s long petticoats when he was a baby. Thus equipped, she
was ready for business. She took from her table a thick paper-backed
volume, one of the â€œlineâ€  of paper novels the druggist kept to sell to
traveling men. She had bought it, only yesterday, because the first
sentence interested her very much, and because she saw, as she glanced
over the pages, the magical names of two Russian cities. The book was a
poor translation of â€œAnna Karenina.â€  Thea opened it at a mark, and
fixed her eyes intently upon the small print. The hymns, the sick girl,
the resigned black figures were forgotten. It was the night of the ball
in Moscow.

Thea would have been astonished if she could have known how, years
afterward, when she had need of them, those old faces were to come back
to her, long after they were hidden away under the earth; that they
would seem to her then as full of meaning, as mysteriously marked by
Destiny, as the people who danced the mazurka under the elegant
Korsunsky.




XVIII


Mr. Kronborg was too fond of his ease and too sensible to worry his
children much about religion. He was more sincere than many preachers,
but when he spoke to his family about matters of conduct it was usually
with a regard for keeping up appearances. The church and church work
were discussed in the family like the routine of any other business.
Sunday was the hard day of the week with them, just as Saturday was the
busy day with the merchants on Main Street. Revivals were seasons of
extra work and pressure, just as threshing-time was on the farms.
Visiting elders had to be lodged and cooked for, the folding-bed in the
parlor was let down, and Mrs. Kronborg had to work in the kitchen all
day long and attend the night meetings.

During one of these revivals Theaâ€™s sister Anna professed religion
with, as Mrs. Kronborg said, â€œa good deal of fluster.â€  While Anna was
going up to the mournersâ€™ bench nightly and asking for the prayers of
the congregation, she disseminated general gloom throughout the
household, and after she joined the church she took on an air of
â€œset-apartnessâ€  that was extremely trying to her brothers and her
sister, though they realized that Annaâ€™s sanctimoniousness was perhaps
a good thing for their father. A preacher ought to have one child who
did more than merely acquiesce in religious observances, and Thea and
the boys were glad enough that it was Anna and not one of themselves
who assumed this obligation.

â€œAnna, sheâ€™s American,â€  Mrs. Kronborg used to say. The Scandinavian
mould of countenance, more or less marked in each of the other
children, was scarcely discernible in her, and she looked enough like
other Moonstone girls to be thought pretty. Annaâ€™s nature was
conventional, like her face. Her position as the ministerâ€™s eldest
daughter was important to her, and she tried to live up to it. She read
sentimental religious story-books and emulated the spiritual struggles
and magnanimous behavior of their persecuted heroines. Everything had
to be interpreted for Anna. Her opinions about the smallest and most
commonplace things were gleaned from the Denver papers, the church
weeklies, from sermons and Sunday-School addresses. Scarcely anything
was attractive to her in its natural stateâ€”indeed, scarcely anything
was decent until it was clothed by the opinion of some authority. Her
ideas about habit, character, duty, love, marriage, were grouped under
heads, like a book of popular quotations, and were totally unrelated to
the emergencies of human living. She discussed all these subjects with
other Methodist girls of her age. They would spend hours, for instance,
in deciding what they would or would not tolerate in a suitor or a
husband, and the frailties of masculine nature were too often a subject
of discussion among them. In her behavior Anna was a harmless girl,
mild except where her prejudices were concerned, neat and industrious,
with no graver fault than priggishness; but her mind had really
shocking habits of classification. The wickedness of Denver and of
Chicago, and even of Moonstone, occupied her thoughts too much. She had
none of the delicacy that goes with a nature of warm impulses, but the
kind of fishy curiosity which justifies itself by an expression of
horror.

Thea, and all Theaâ€™s ways and friends, seemed indecorous to Anna. She
not only felt a grave social discrimination against the Mexicans; she
could not forget that Spanish Johnny was a drunkard and that â€œnobody
knew what he did when he ran away from home.â€  Thea pretended, of
course, that she liked the Mexicans because they were fond of music;
but every one knew that music was nothing very real, and that it did
not matter in a girlâ€™s relations with people. What was real, then, and
what did matter? Poor Anna!

Anna approved of Ray Kennedy as a young man of steady habits and
blameless life, but she regretted that he was an atheist, and that he
was not a passenger conductor with brass buttons on his coat. On the
whole, she wondered what such an exemplary young man found to like in
Thea. Dr. Archie she treated respectfully because of his position in
Moonstone, but she _knew_ he had kissed the Mexican barytoneâ€™s pretty
daughter, and she had a whole _dossier_ of evidence about his behavior
in his hours of relaxation in Denver. He was â€œfast,â€  and it was because
he was â€œfastâ€  that Thea liked him. Thea always liked that kind of
people. Dr. Archieâ€™s whole manner with Thea, Anna often told her
mother, was too free. He was always putting his hand on Theaâ€™s head, or
holding her hand while he laughed and looked down at her. The kindlier
manifestation of human nature (about which Anna sang and talked, in the
interests of which she went to conventions and wore white ribbons) were
never realities to her after all. She did not believe in them. It was
only in attitudes of protest or reproof, clinging to the cross, that
human beings could be even temporarily decent.

Preacher Kronborgâ€™s secret convictions were very much like Annaâ€™s. He
believed that his wife was absolutely good, but there was not a man or
woman in his congregation whom he trusted all the way.

Mrs. Kronborg, on the other hand, was likely to find something to
admire in almost any human conduct that was positive and energetic. She
could always be taken in by the stories of tramps and runaway boys. She
went to the circus and admired the bareback riders, who were â€œlikely
good enough women in their way.â€  She admired Dr. Archieâ€™s fine physique
and well-cut clothes as much as Thea did, and said she â€œfelt it was a
privilege to be handled by such a gentleman when she was sick.â€ 

Soon after Anna became a church member she began to remonstrate with
Thea about practicingâ€”playing â€œsecular musicâ€ â€”on Sunday. One Sunday the
dispute in the parlor grew warm and was carried to Mrs. Kronborg in the
kitchen. She listened judicially and told Anna to read the chapter
about how Naaman the leper was permitted to bow down in the house of
Rimmon. Thea went back to the piano, and Anna lingered to say that,
since she was in the right, her mother should have supported her.

â€œNo,â€  said Mrs. Kronborg, rather indifferently, â€œI canâ€™t see it that
way, Anna. I never forced you to practice, and I donâ€™t see as I should
keep Thea from it. I like to hear her, and I guess your father does.
You and Thea will likely follow different lines, and I donâ€™t see as Iâ€™m
called upon to bring you up alike.â€ 

Anna looked meek and abused. â€œOf course all the church people must hear
her. Ours is the only noisy house on this street. You hear what sheâ€™s
playing now, donâ€™t you?â€ 

Mrs. Kronborg rose from browning her coffee. â€œYes; itâ€™s the Blue Danube
waltzes. Iâ€™m familiar with â€™em. If any of the church people come at
you, you just send â€™em to me. I ainâ€™t afraid to speak out on occasion,
and I wouldnâ€™t mind one bit telling the Ladiesâ€™ Aid a few things about
standard composers.â€  Mrs. Kronborg smiled, and added thoughtfully, â€œNo,
I wouldnâ€™t mind that one bit.â€ 

Anna went about with a reserved and distant air for a week, and Mrs.
Kronborg suspected that she held a larger place than usual in her
daughterâ€™s prayers; but that was another thing she didnâ€™t mind.

Although revivals were merely a part of the yearâ€™s work, like
examination week at school, and although Annaâ€™s piety impressed her
very little, a time came when Thea was perplexed about religion. A
scourge of typhoid broke out in Moonstone and several of Theaâ€™s
schoolmates died of it. She went to their funerals, saw them put into
the ground, and wondered a good deal about them. But a certain grim
incident, which caused the epidemic, troubled her even more than the
death of her friends.

Early in July, soon after Theaâ€™s fifteenth birthday, a particularly
disgusting sort of tramp came into Moonstone in an empty box car. Thea
was sitting in the hammock in the front yard when he first crawled up
to the town from the depot, carrying a bundle wrapped in dirty ticking
under one arm, and under the other a wooden box with rusty screening
nailed over one end. He had a thin, hungry face covered with black
hair. It was just before suppertime when he came along, and the street
smelled of fried potatoes and fried onions and coffee. Thea saw him
sniffing the air greedily and walking slower and slower. He looked over
the fence. She hoped he would not stop at their gate, for her mother
never turned any one away, and this was the dirtiest and most utterly
wretched-looking tramp she had ever seen. There was a terrible odor
about him, too. She caught it even at that distance, and put her
handkerchief to her nose. A moment later she was sorry, for she knew
that he had noticed it. He looked away and shuffled a little faster.

A few days later Thea heard that the tramp had camped in an empty shack
over on the east edge of town, beside the ravine, and was trying to
give a miserable sort of show there. He told the boys who went to see
what he was doing, that he had traveled with a circus. His bundle
contained a filthy clownâ€™s suit, and his box held half a dozen
rattlesnakes.

Saturday night, when Thea went to the butcher shop to get the chickens
for Sunday, she heard the whine of an accordion and saw a crowd before
one of the saloons. There she found the tramp, his bony body
grotesquely attired in the clownâ€™s suit, his face shaved and painted
white,â€”the sweat trickling through the paint and washing it away,â€”and
his eyes wild and feverish. Pulling the accordion in and out seemed to
be almost too great an effort for him, and he panted to the tune of
â€œMarching through Georgia.â€  After a considerable crowd had gathered,
the tramp exhibited his box of snakes, announced that he would now pass
the hat, and that when the onlookers had contributed the sum of one
dollar, he would eat â€œone of these living reptiles.â€  The crowd began to
cough and murmur, and the saloon keeper rushed off for the marshal, who
arrested the wretch for giving a show without a license and hurried him
away to the calaboose.

The calaboose stood in a sunflower patch,â€”an old hut with a barred
window and a padlock on the door. The tramp was utterly filthy and
there was no way to give him a bath. The law made no provision to
grub-stake vagrants, so after the constable had detained the tramp for
twentyfour hours, he released him and told him to â€œget out of town, and
get quick.â€  The fellowâ€™s rattlesnakes had been killed by the saloon
keeper. He hid in a box car in the freight yard, probably hoping to get
a ride to the next station, but he was found and put out. After that he
was seen no more. He had disappeared and left no trace except an ugly,
stupid word, chalked on the black paint of the seventy-five-foot
standpipe which was the reservoir for the Moonstone water-supply; the
same word, in another tongue, that the French soldier shouted at
Waterloo to the English officer who bade the Old Guard surrender; a
comment on life which the defeated, along the hard roads of the world,
sometimes bawl at the victorious.

A week after the tramp excitement had passed over, the city water began
to smell and to taste. The Kronborgs had a well in their back yard and
did not use city water, but they heard the complaints of their
neighbors. At first people said that the town well was full of rotting
